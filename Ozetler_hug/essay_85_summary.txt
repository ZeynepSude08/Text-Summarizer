----- ÖZET -----
Neural stem cells must be used as a therapeutic measure to slow or halt the aging process due to their differentiation capabilities. Pluripotent stem cells, or PSCs, are the best candidates for in vitro generation and cultivation of neural stem cells. The study focuses on two key neural stem cell pools in the mammalian brain.
