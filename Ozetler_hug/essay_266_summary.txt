----- ÖZET -----
The supply and demand theory is utilized to understand the customers’ buying behaviors and help managers strategize the product in the market in accordance with them. A lack of demand for the product signifies that supply needs to be shortened – and vice versa: when there is an increase of demand, it is reasonable to enhance supply.
