----- ÖZET -----
Dayak culture promotes the empowerement of both genders based on the characteristics which define them. These positives are then brought together to contribute to the wellbeing of society as well as personal relationships. Western society gives value to hypermasculinity and aggression as definitions of males, exemplified via the genitalia.
