----- ÖZET -----
The doctor’s job is to follow ethical standards, including loyalty to patients and respect for their choice. Physician-assisted suicide can be seen as voluntary death by a medical professional. However, such cooperation on the part of a doctor cannot be ethically conditioned. Allowing euthanasia can cause irreparable harm to the patient.
