----- ÖZET -----
The purpose of interviewing the victim is to prepare him for the court sessions. By questioning the victim, the advocate can tell whether he is giving all the needed information. The setting of the interview is critical to the willingness and chances of the victim to communicate. The interviewee should never feel like the interviewer is being judgmental.
