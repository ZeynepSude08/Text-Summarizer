----- ÖZET -----
Gendered behavior denotes fundamental expressions of gender socialization and identity through an individual’s various developmental phases. One of the prominent gendered behaviors instilled in me during childhood was that women are the primary cooks in the home. In many ways, many subsequently considered women to be unfit for specific job descriptions.
