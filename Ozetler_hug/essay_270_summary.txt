----- ÖZET -----
Disney’s culture and policy are based on mass entertainment and recreation for children and the whole family. Disney does not need to apply extraordinary and drastic changes to the brand and products like Pixar. It is only necessary to focus particular attention on streaming services and the development of theme parks.
