----- ÖZET -----
Descartes’ philosophy is called dualistic, which implies the equality of the material and the ideal. In one of his main theses devoted to the study of the interaction between the mind and body, the philosopher speaks of their opposition. Descartes guarantees the truth of the original principle as clear and distinct knowledge by the existence of God.
