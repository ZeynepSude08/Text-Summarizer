----- ÖZET -----
A childhood ear infection is caused by celiac disease, a chronic small intestine enteropathy resulting from exposure to the protein gluten. Ear infections begin when the child has a cold, sore throat, and diverse upper respiratory infections resulting from bacterial or viral infections that spread to the middle ear. Out of six children, five have the potential of demonstrating at least one ear infection by the age of three years (NIH, n.d.)
