----- ÖZET -----
Public transportation was designed to help people commute from outside the cities inwards and vice versa. Most studies show that most Americans today commute between suburban routes that are not served by the public transport system. The government must first change its perspective on public transportation by looking at it from a public service rather than from a capitalist point of view. Restructuring trains and buses are stopping points to minimize the walking distance between stops.
