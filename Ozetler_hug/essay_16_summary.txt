----- ÖZET -----
A felony of attempt should be punished in the same way as the underlying substantive offence. The use of force towards the bank teller cannot be one of a separate crime from what is intended by the accused in the first place. Any wrongdoing that arises from and within this intended offense will be absorbed into the crime itself.
