----- ÖZET -----
Refractory high entropy superalloys have an ordered crystal structure which improves the capability to withstand high temperatures by reinforcing it. Additive manufacturing is an alternative to the traditional methods of composite production. The newly discovered capacity of artificial intelligence can significantly enhance the quality of 3D printers and make them more accurate.
