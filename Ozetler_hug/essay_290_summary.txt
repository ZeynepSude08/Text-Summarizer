----- ÖZET -----
Darwin’s theory of evolution was fundamental in discussing the unique occurrences and developments in human sciences. Understanding the working of the human brain gives a clear indication of how the brain is so developed as compared to other organisms. This explains why in every century, new developments are made and new scientific studies are identified.
