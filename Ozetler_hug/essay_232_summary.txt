----- ÖZET -----
A Western scholarship has distorted the long history of African culture for centuries. As a result, the ideas and tenets of African philosophy have been appropriated and changed in value. The imposition of European views on the distinction between culture and philosophy, religion and spirituality have disrupted African people’s ability to self-identify. African culture is inherently linked to philosophy, spirituality, living in the moment, and seeing the richness of life.
