----- ÖZET -----
“Bowling Alone” by Robert Putnam Essay (Critical Writing) (1995) Putnam says that the social life of the USA collapses, and it is difficult to predict the results of this process. The results cannot be predicted as the USA has always been a state with strong community relations. If nothing changes, we will bowl alone.
