----- ÖZET -----
Coronary heart disease is a widely diagnosed physiological impairment that adversely impacts human well-being, healthy functioning and often leads to increased mortality. The disease is caused by “the presence of an obstructive atherosclerotic plaque, which causes a blood flow reduction to the myocardium” (Severino et al., 2020, p. 2). Atherosclerosis further results in myocardial ischemia, which might result in a heart attack.
