----- ÖZET -----
Researchers demonstrate that Hispanic individuals deal with improved diabetes prevention when they participate in individual and group face-to-face sessions (McCurley et al., 2017). I believe that there is an apparent reason why such positive outcomes are achieved. It seems that face- to-face interventions are effective because patients have an opportunity to ask questions.
