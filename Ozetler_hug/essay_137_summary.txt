----- ÖZET -----
The history of blood transfusion dates back to ancient times when people tried to treat animals with blood. The first documented intravenous injections refer to the beginning of the world’s first academy of sciences – the Royal Society of London, founded in the 60s of the 17th century. In 1932, the first blood bank was established in a Leningrad hospital.
