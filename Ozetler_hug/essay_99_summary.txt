----- ÖZET -----
The adversarial criminal justice system is one where the law is applied equally to all segments of the society. It is a system that presumes that one is innocent that shifts the burden of proof to the prosecution to prove beyond any shadow of a doubt. This system poses some ethical problems because most of its procedural safeguards are always in favour of the accused.
