----- ÖZET -----
The bail reform is a part of a series of criminal justice reforms that have gone into effect in recent years. The original motivation behind the bail reform was centered around the inequality issues and disparities that allowed the rich to buy their freedom and return home. According to Baughman (2019), done right, bail keeps dangerous individuals off the streets; done wrong, it keeps those with less economic means in jail longer.
