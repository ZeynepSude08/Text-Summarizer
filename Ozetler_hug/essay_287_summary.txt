----- ÖZET -----
Chanmugam et al. (2015) dwell on the issue of education quality in domestic violence shelters. When exposed to an unprecedently high level of stress, children tend to focus less on academic performance due to poor socialization, constant mobility, lack of parental and educators’ supervision, and mental and behavioral challenges. The study demonstrates that despite a series of barriers, the overall tendency of educational services for children exposed to domestic violence is optimistic.
