----- ÖZET -----
In Alabama, the immigration policy regarding access to education is more unfavorable to undocumented immigrants compared to that of California. California passed the Dream Act, which allows immigrants to pay equal tuition fee rates as other Native Americans. The higher population of immigrants in California pushes the states to create a positive environment for the majority as opposed to Alabama.
