----- ÖZET -----
Afghanistan has no access to the sea or the ocean and is adjacent to other states from all sides. Multi-ethnicity is the reason for the bilingual and trilingual nature of the local population. Islam for contemporary Afghanistan is the bridge that connects disparate nationalities and smoothes out conflicts.
