----- ÖZET -----
The barriers that firms may face on their way to internal logistical integration are possible to group into five categories by their origin and nature. The first derives from an insufficiently coherent structure of a business that results in poor communication among its departments. The traditional systems of management and reward also can be an obstacle to internal integration.
