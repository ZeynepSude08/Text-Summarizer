----- ÖZET -----
Asthma is a serious disease that affects about 25 million Americans and causes nearly 1.6 million emergency room visits every year. The disease causes swelling and narrowing of the respiratory tract and the possible occurrence of excessive mucus on them. An asthma attack can become a particular danger for asthma patients. An unfavorable prognosis is that such a respiratory disease as asthma is not fully treated.
