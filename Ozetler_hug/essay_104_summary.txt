----- ÖZET -----
Globalization is the extent to which information, investments, trade, political cooperation, cultural values, and social ideas flow among different countries. It is creating a borderless world for managers by allowing them to conduct their operations internationally rather than locally. The international landscape is changing since China, India, and Brazil demonstrate economic growth and play an important role in global business.
