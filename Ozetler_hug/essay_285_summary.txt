----- ÖZET -----
Venezuela’s crisis is based on corruption, overreliance on the oil industry, and income inequality. Yet, it would be an overstatement to state that the US does not face these problems, although it does have a diversified economy. As such, socialism does not necessarily lead to ruin – people's greed and laziness do.
