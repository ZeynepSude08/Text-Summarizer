----- ÖZET -----
Epithelial tissue is composed of cells that are laid together in sheets. The cells of the epithelium have a flat shape and are arranged using a single layer. This layer is thin enough that it allows forming of a membrane through which the compounds can move with the help of diffusion. Simple squamous epithelia allow for facilitating gas diffusion as well as small molecules.
