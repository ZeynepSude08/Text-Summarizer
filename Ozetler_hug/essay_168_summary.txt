----- ÖZET -----
The Diels-Alder reaction is traditionally used to produce stereospecific six-membered carbon cycles with multiple bonds. Two types of reagents are used for this reaction, one being a conjugated diene and the other a dienophile. In 1927, the process was patented by German organic chemists Otto Diels and Kurt Alder.
