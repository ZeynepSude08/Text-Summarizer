----- ÖZET -----
A recent Chicago hot dog restaurant incident can be considered an ethical issue. The offender's actions were disproportional to the situation, apart from the obvious property damage offense. A utilitarian point of view would consider this incident wrong by examining the consequences of the offender’s actions.
