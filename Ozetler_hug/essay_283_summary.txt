----- ÖZET -----
Eating habits and culture of food consumption are subject to analysis to identify patterns that might yield an impact (positive or negative) on the environment from both short- and long-term perspectives. This paper presents a reflective analysis of the author’s eating habit-informed environmental worldview, the health of their connection with nature, and probable spiritual practices.
