----- ÖZET -----
The Southern Gothic is a literal tradition that came into existence in the 20 th century and became popular in European literature. The genre is rooted in mysterious secrets, supernatural events, frightening scenarios, and extreme character duress, which leaves the reader desensitized. A Rose for Emily is an excellent example of the Southern Gothic genre.
