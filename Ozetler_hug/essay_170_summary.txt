----- ÖZET -----
The Chesapeake colonies is a bright example of how slavery became one of the integral parts of societies existing on these lands. The necessity to grow specific crops and use them to earn money and survive resulted in the constantly growing demand for the workforce. The Middle colonies proves that the enslavement of people and their use as a cheap workforce was inevitable.
