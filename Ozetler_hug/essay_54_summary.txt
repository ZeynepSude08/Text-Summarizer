----- ÖZET -----
The Bosch manual contains numerous illustrations, schemes, and bullet points that make it easy to read. The largest part of the text is presented in the form of bullet points. The manual is ethical because it is objective, integrated, and was created by competent authors. It does not contain any references or explain how the dishwasher is working in detail.
