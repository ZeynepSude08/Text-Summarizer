----- ÖZET -----
The work of a clinical or medical office worker is characterized by a combination of a large number of administrative operations with medical activities. All healthcare workers, including office workers, must wear a special uniform called scrubs, consisting of a short-sleeved shirt and trousers. The choice of purchasing a uniform will depend on the rules of a particular hospital.
