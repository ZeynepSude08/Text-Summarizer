----- ÖZET -----
A mutation is a change in the genome of an organism. The ADRB1 gene is responsible for regulating the amount of sleep a person needs each night to function properly. About 5% of the population enjoys a slightly different mutant version. Such a mutation does not affect the human population in the general world.
