----- ÖZET -----
The editing in the first episode of the series Money Heist is in line with its thrilling plot and rapid action. The characters’ close-ups are dynamic, often using dolly shots to slowly expose the background or move with the character. Hand-held shots are also used, and they are consistent with scenes where characters feel insecure, aggressive, scared, or exposed.
