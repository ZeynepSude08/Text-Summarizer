----- ÖZET -----
Lemonade is a natural progression of the modern mainstream soundtrack’s exploration of black feminism. Beyonce signalled a conscious and evident transition in her articulation of femininity and identity with explicit allusions to political equality in her Lemonade album. Lemonade can be said to be an anti-Black feminist composition due to its hints of Afrocentrism, which maintains multiple misogynistic views about Black women.
