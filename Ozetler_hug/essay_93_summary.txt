----- ÖZET -----
U.S. states have large autonomy and have their own constitutions. But they should not contradict the federal U.s. Constitution, including the first ten amendments to it – the Bill of Rights. If the state constitution contradicts the federal one, it might signal a lack of unity and democracy within the country. The paper aims to analyze Article I of the Florida Constitution. It shows that the state shares the same democratic values as all Americans.
