----- ÖZET -----
Attaining sustainability is the optimal way of humanity’s long-term development. To enable this outcome, the nature of the relationship between people and their planet needs to change. This includes the respect of nature as something that had existed long before the dawn of humanity. In a sustainable future, the biodiversity goals described by Diaz et al. (2020) will be completed.
