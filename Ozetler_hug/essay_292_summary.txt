----- ÖZET -----
An entrepreneur must understand the market’s requirements and then reintroduce the same notion uniquely and creatively to attract consumers’ attention. An idea is a fundamental notion explored but not executed, while ideation concretizes such abstract ideas into concepts. To be successful as an entrepreneur involves developing visionary ideas artistically by adding aesthetic appeal.
