----- ÖZET -----
The “zero-sum story” is a belief that there is a competition between racial groups, and any progress for one group is a threat to the resources and position of another. This story is the mainstream paradigm for conservative media and has been told in different forms for years. This mindset created additional economic, political, and social costs for all citizens of the United States.
