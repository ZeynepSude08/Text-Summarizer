----- ÖZET -----
The Holocaust Museum Houston serves as a monument and strives to teach people about the consequences of cruelty and prejudice. “Bearing Witness: A Community Remembers,” a permanent display at the museum, conveys the Holocaust story directly from the source. The museum’s interactive aspect was one of my favorites since it offered depictions of natural occurrences.
