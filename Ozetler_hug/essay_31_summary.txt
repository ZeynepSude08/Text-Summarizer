----- ÖZET -----
The rhythmic accounting rap song Debit Credit Theory by Colin Dodds (n.d.) is an excellent way to remember that debit’s location is the left side of the account. The mnemonic offered by Heather McNellis (2020) also contributes to better understanding and remembering the essence of debit and credit and the account balances.
