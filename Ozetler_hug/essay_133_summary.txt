----- ÖZET -----
Biracial people have many advantages that open many opportunities for the non-standard perception of the world. Multi-racial persons can have better self-esteem than mono-racial people if they are nurtured to identify with both parents. Mixed-race offspring are more likely to inherit a variety of physical traits.
