----- ÖZET -----
Burke’s pentad presents a simple tool for analyzing dramatic situations that can be used to examine texts and other narratives. This framework describes such elements as act, agent, scene, agency, and purpose, as well as their relations. The pentad determines how an individual acts in a certain case and what his motivation is.
