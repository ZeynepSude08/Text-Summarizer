----- ÖZET -----
A good leader understands the paramount importance of employees in any enterprise. A bad leader always looks at people through the prism of a solid resource and cheap labor. The main mistake of many leaders in any business is an overly egocentric picture of the world and a tendency to immoral exploitation of people’s resources.
