----- ÖZET -----
Christopher Lee Peterson was a follower of the World Church of the Creator. In 2000, Peterson gave an interview to the local paper expressing his racist views. The company president suspended Peterson without pay and later demoted him to a lower pay and responsibility role. Since according to Title VII it is unlawful to discriminate based on religious views, the plaintiff sued the organization for the demotion.
