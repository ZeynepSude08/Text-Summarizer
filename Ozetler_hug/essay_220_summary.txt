----- ÖZET -----
The current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic agenda is markedly different from what was relevant for 2020. The focus has clearly shifted from personal health and medical issues to topics of public welfare and civil rights recognition. Each individual has the moral right to determine whether he or she is willing to take responsibility for his or her life through vaccination.
