----- ÖZET -----
People are marginalized based on their race, ethnicity, and social class. The criminal justice system should be inclusive of all races, genders, and other identifying features. Minorities and people who do not meet society’s “norms” are frequently subjected to unequal treatment by those charged with protecting them.
