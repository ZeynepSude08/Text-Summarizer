----- ÖZET -----
Christianity authors the belief in the existence of a sovereign God who controls everything in the universe. Postmodern relativism takes a liberal approach to spirituality and ethics. Scientism regards soft sciences as inferior or pseudosciences since their conjectures and guesses are not replicable or factual.
