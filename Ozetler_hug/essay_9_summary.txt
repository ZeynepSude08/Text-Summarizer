----- ÖZET -----
A Complex in the “Every Secret Thing” Film by Berg Essay by Gary Bobroff. Carl Jung identifies the mother complex with an innate feeling of care at the center of the emotional attachment between a mother and a child. In the absence of such an attachment, an archetype develops where someone's mother fails to satisfy the essential demands associated with the relationship. The outcome leads the victim, the child, to seek comfort elsewhere.
