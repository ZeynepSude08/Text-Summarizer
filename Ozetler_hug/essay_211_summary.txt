----- ÖZET -----
The decline of the 14-15th centuries, also known as the crisis of the late Middle Ages, is a term used in Western historiography to refer to the recession processes that took place in some countries of Western Europe. The Middle Ages were once seen as a time of ignorance and social oppression, it is now understood as a dynamic period during which Europe as a separate cultural unit appeared.
