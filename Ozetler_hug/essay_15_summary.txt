----- ÖZET -----
A Horror Film as a Form of Modern Public Lynching Essay by Stephen King. Stephen King argued that people aim to re-establish their feelings of essential normality. Horror films are not the modern version of public lynching; they formulate a way for people to obtain a strong emotional response through fear. The strong reaction makes horror films stand out in terms of the criteria for assessing art.
