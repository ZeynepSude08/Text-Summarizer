----- ÖZET -----
The collapse of WorldCom in 2002 provides a nice example of the lack of proper communication in a corporation. The inability of various top managers and accountants to communicate efficiently in order to prevent frauds is always disastrous. The reasons for all the misunderstanding and complicated series of negotiations are rooted in barriers to communication that include motive distortion and extreme self-absorption.
