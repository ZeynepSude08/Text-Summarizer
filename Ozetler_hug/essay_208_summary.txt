----- ÖZET -----
Law enforcement was founded on the need to ensure citizens’ safety, possession, and health. In its primitive system, law enforcement clan members banded together to enforce rules of the group on rogue members. Peace offices have the mandate of ensuring that whether on or off duty, they shall not commit any crime knowingly under the country’s laws.
