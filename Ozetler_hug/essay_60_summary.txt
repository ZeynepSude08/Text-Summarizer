----- ÖZET -----
Guaman Poma witnessed the injustices of the colonial government and personally suffered by its hands. He published a 1200-page illustrated document addressed to the Spanish king, chronicling the Andean way of life before invasion. His notion that the government should be created for and by the people that have historically occupied the land it rules over is strikingly modern.
