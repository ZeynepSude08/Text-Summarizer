----- ÖZET -----
The 2013 film 12 Years a Slave proved that slavery is a worldwide issue. This movie accurately illustrates discriminatory relationships between white slaveholders and black slaves that stemmed from the dysfunctional system in the country and prejudices in people’s mindsets at that time. The movie also showed prejudice, generalizations, stereotyping, and discrimination against black people.
