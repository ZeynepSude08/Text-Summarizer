----- ÖZET -----
Blues-inspired poetry reflects the interaction between literary art and musical tradition that originates from the early 20 th century. Blues poetry is stylistically similar to blues music in that it does not attempt to incorporate a variety of complex language forms and rhymes. James Weldon Johnson (1927) created a poem that is titled Go Down, Death.
