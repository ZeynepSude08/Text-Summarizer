----- ÖZET -----
Cultural competence evolved from assumptions about patients based on nationality to the implementation of patient-centered care principles. It includes learning, empathy, responsiveness to the needs, values, ​​and preferences of patients. The cultural competence of doctors is not a panacea that can improve health and eliminate inequalities by itself.
