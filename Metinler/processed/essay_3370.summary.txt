kinesio taping actively used prevention muscle joint injuries healthy people rehabilitation various injuries. kinesio tape easily attaches muscular skeleton, supporting suppressing muscle activity, well providing stability ligaments joints park et al. thus, kinesio taping used coaching prevent occurrence joint muscle injuries, well relieve muscle joint pain rehabilitation period. mechanical property kinesio taping provide stable joint position external physical force park et al. 2. kinesio taping positive effect balance performance helps prevent injury, especially healthy athletes. partially supported yang et al., emphasize kinesio taping improves control muscle positioning, positive effect contraction 4. 4. assumption also supported hosp et al., emphasize kinesio tape increases sensory feedback mechanoreceptors located skin, muscles, joint capsules 640. although studies reviewed suggest widespread use kinesio taping rehabilitation various muscle groups, use coaching healthy people depends load nature movements. particular, illustrated article park et al., increasing muscle resistance tape positive effect results therapy dysphagia 1. time, effectiveness results using kinesio taping improve performance healthy people rehabilitation depend technique duration use. general, information use kinesio taping improve performance athletes, well rehabilitation joint muscle injuries, controversial.
