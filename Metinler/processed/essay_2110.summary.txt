thus, study design intended provide empirically valid theory answering research questions posed. study focuses systematic design provides rigorous structured procedural guidelines conducting research based grounded theory strategy guetterman et al., 2019. used study, grounded theory defined qualitative research method uses systematic series procedures develop inductively derived grounded theory phenomenon study charmaz belgrave, 2019. whereas quantitative data collection requires technical side process, qualitative data collection requires creation series semistructured interview guides ensure data collection systematic monitored researchers. instead labeling studied experiences practices, researcher code research materials vivo, thus reflecting categories immediate phenomena reflected objectified participants themselves. addition, another condition ensuring validity qualitative research grounded theory method theoretical sampling, i.e., strategy assumes flexible variable change sample research process attracting new people information korstjens moser, 2018. example, medical educators apply research findings assessment methods demonstrate rolebased video recording communication situations helps students prepare reallife clinical practice. ensure transferability study, detailed description study methodology, particular approach conduct, study participants, study conditions, data analysis methodology, provided, allow researchers also determine validity study results. triangulation means use different methods example, qualitative andor quantitative check validity research results minimize source error example, researcher bias korstjens moser, 2018. triangulation, context, onephase blended study design combining methods collecting analyzing qualitative quantitative data. mixed methods strategy used study makes possible obtain reliable empirical data reason quantitative method complements validates overall qualitative strategy. validating study results, research team also ask study participants review study results interpretations provided researchers.
