capnography cardiopulmonary resuscitation research paper broad topic area topic direct practice improvement dpi project use capnography resuscitation intensive care unit icu, focus nurses adoption tool. capnography one possible methods measure level etco 2 resuscitation, many hospitals use improve patients outcomes. first works, use capnography main subject, considering potential benefits resuscitation outcomes patient wellbeing. focus employees facilitators change crucial dpi project considers nurses use capnography center investigation explains connection nurses knowledge, adoption capnography, clinical uncertainty. nursing knowledge capnography resuscitation success capnography depends level knowledge technique nurses would possess implementation tool. enough nurses learn use capnography measure levels etco 2, must also understand interpret available readings various waveforms kiekkas et al., 2016. outcomes capnography nurses patients quality care level knowledge nurses gain closely connected chosen theoretical guidelines clinical experiences hassankhani, aghdam, rahmani, mohammadpoorfard, 2015. learning interpret results capnography, nurses also increase ability predict guide cases resuscitation different care units pantazopoulos et al., 2015. problem statement known degree implementation evidencebased intervention use capnography acute care hospital northeastern u.s. would impact rate use capnography use cpr, compared current practice among adult icu patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation icu four week period. research discussed literature review shows crucial role capnography play outcome resuscitation hassankhani et al., 2015 kiekkas et al., 2016. vital address problem see whether change project positively influences nurses actions well patient outcomes related cardiac arrest resuscitation. clinical questions, hypotheses, variables central clinical question guides project degree implementation evidencebased intervention use capnography cardiopulmonary resuscitation, lead increased use capnography cardiopulmonary resuscitation compared current practice, among adult icu patients acute care hospital setting northeastern u.s within four week period? patients experienced cardiac arrest underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation without use capnography icu. use capnography cardiopulmonary resuscitation means application capnography techniques track patients etco2 levels cpr pantazopoulos et al., 2015. nurses adoption tool depends awareness capnography techniques benefits, well competence regards technical equipment use etco2 levels interpretation pantazopoulos et al., 2015. purpose statement purpose quantitative, quasiexperimental project determine degree implementation capnography cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr compared current practice would increase use capnography cpr adult icu patients acute care hospital northeastern united states. project contribute knowledge nurses use capnography preparedness apply tool cpr icu. data collection approach main data collection method used project nurses knowledge capnography test kiekkas et al., 2016 nelson, 2018. nurses take part project receive structured surveys based nurses knowledge capnography test nkct, investigator also collect hospitals records resuscitation patient outcomes comparison. sheak, k.r., wiebe, d.j., leary, m., babaeizadeh, s., yuen, t.c., zive, d., abella, b.s. 2015.
