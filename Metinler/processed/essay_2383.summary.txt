paper discuss scatter plot created based variables provided linear regression model explain variation show hypothesis test result. multiple r amounted approximately 0,915, relatively high value, zero, indicates positive strong relationship two variables, well previously explained tool, does. significance f value equals 0,00000437, considered low one values greater 0,05 suggest utilizing predictors show dependence two variables weak bevans, 2020. addition, pvalue much lower significance level, supports claim strong relationship variables, null hypothesis outlined rejected. despite small number observations make analysiss results deceiving, examined indicators prove model trustworthy, dependency mostly explained, found relationship variables strong also positive one according scatter plot. based number observations variables, equal variance ttest suitable mahesh, 2019.
