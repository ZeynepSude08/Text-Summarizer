seabird extinction invasive rodent species research paper table contents 1. ways protecting seabirds invasive rodent species 6. unfortunately, present, many seabird species risk extinction multiple anthropogenic threats, including bycatch, invasive species, land use, climate change, energy production richards et al., 2021. among them, invasive rodent species destructive environment especially affect seabirds scanes, 2018. paper review seabirds role ecosystems, invasive rodent species impact seabirds, methods protecting seabirds nonnative rodents. invasive rodent species mentioned, seabirds often live islands predatory mammals previously inhabit. according scanes 2018, four invasive rodent species threatening survival seabirds. study analyzing seabirds traits increase risk affected rodents found species pelagic specialism slow reproductive speed vulnerable rodent threats richards et al., 2021. rodent species also pose significant threat survival endemic seabird species vireo gracilirostris elaenia ridleyana fernando de noronha micheletti et al., 2020. evidence suggests that, without effective interventions, seabirds increased risk extinction due invasive rodent species predation. ways protecting seabirds invasive rodent species previously, eradicating rodents islands considered impossible task. saintpaul island, situated south indian ocean, rat eradication resulted increased seabird population growth rates 20 years later, especially species vulnerable rodent depredation barbraud et al., 2021. conclusion sum up, traveling ships, humans introduced invasive rodent species islands serving habitat many seabird species.
