enhancing individual collaborative eyewitness memory category clustering recall. present paper discusses scholarly article enhancing individual collaborative eyewitness memory category clustering recall, critically reviewing primary elements. nevertheless, current body research uses different approach phenomenon, presenting category clustering recall manifest collaborative data recollection might effective vredeveldt et al., 2016. according research, allowing individuals freely describe event circumstances facilitating remembering asking categoryspecific questions induce recollection aid retrieving additional data vredeveldt et al., 2016, 2017. considering positive results research utilizing category clustering recall reported benefits group memory, question arises whether use category clustering recall might diminish negative effects group inhibition. discussed article clearly contributes understanding category clustering recall implementation improving quality information retrieval individual group evidence recollection. first all, concluded collaborative groups generally efficient recollecting information, lone individuals make memory retrieval errors frequently. authors also report individual collective participation nonsignificant instance, suggesting category cluster recall highly efficient evidence recollection strategy contrasted free recall. conclusion conclude, article enhancing individual collaborative eyewitness memory category clustering recall critically reviewed paper, outlining major ideas research discussing disadvantages. overall, reported individual recollection less timeefficient, collaborative recall offers less credible knowledge comparison, reporting evidence previously unmet individuals improves information quality. enhancing individual collaborative eyewitness memory category clustering recall.
