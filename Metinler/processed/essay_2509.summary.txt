equations above, f represents force exerted, k spring constant given nm, x extension compression given difference new original lengths material. objectives experimentally determine relationship force exerted spring extension compression produced determine spring constant graphical data materials verticallyhanging spring different masses ruler preliminary set questions different elastic materials different spring constants, implying react differently forces exerted them. three main elements studied experiment mass, force, spring constant, extension. graph shows linear relationship mass extension, slope giving springs constant. appendixes basic definitions hookes law law states extension directly proportional applied force mass quantity matter extension difference length application weight spring equations fkx kdfdx fforce exerted spring, kspring constant, x extension reference mazur, e.
