trebuchets projectile weight effect projectile distance research paper introduction gravitypowered machines, trebuchets, long considered famous engineering invention middle ages, used throw weapons war. interest context relationship projectile weight horizontal distance traveled projectile. experiments hypothesis states increase projectiles weight causes decrease distance traveled projectile. research question effect weight projectile trebuchet mechanism projectile range? variables present experimental work investigates relationship projectile weight horizontal distance trebuchet, therefore possible assume variables used study. independent variable manipulated work weight projectile trebuchet. table 2 shows results obtained measuring throw distance various masses projectiles diameter 1 meter 45degree angle release. presentation processed data using ms excel, scatter plot dependence throw range initial projectile weight launched constructed. dependence maximum projectile range weight projectile trebuchet. gradient negative value, suggests increase projectile weight independent variable causes decrease horizontal distance dependent variable. thus, horizontal distance traveled projectile inverse relationship projectiles weight. hints 100 kg, additional weight projectile decreases distance traveled smaller amount. addition projectiles weight, could length short arm lever angle displacement additional characteristics affecting variable. therefore, creates interesting topic research understand relationship wheels, trebuchets motion, distance traveled projectile.
