lack typical threedimensional longrange organization crystal structures, thus, amorphous solids much randomized arrangement molecules. amorphous solids similar liquids throughout lack ordered structure threedimensional arrangements atoms electrons. examples amorphous solids clay, plastic, glass. due general random pattern atoms molecules within amorphous lattice, amorphous materials defined structure geometry nicolas et al., 2019. since lack crystalline structure shown figure 1 flow properties, amorphous solids sometimes referred pseudosolids well supercooled liquids. fig 1 structure amorphous solid lalena et al., 2020. properties amorphous solids amorphous solids display following qualities, possess shortrange order, sharp melting point, pseudo solids nature, isotropic, indefinite heat fusion, show rough irregular surfaces cut two. electrical properties electrical current applied across amorphous solid, offers high resistance flow current. plastics amorphous solids, example, plastics offer high resistance flow electricity thus called good electrical insulators. quartz, crystalline material sio2, heated melt quickly cooled, forms amorphous solid called silica glass. glasses, candy resins, plastics examples amorphous solids. characteristic features crystalline solids amorphous solids atomic structure regular irregular melting point constant temperature range temperatures shape regular irregular cleavage cut two smooth sharp surfaces rough irregular surfaces fusion heat definite indefinite physical nature true solids pseudo solids anisotropy anisotropic isotropic fig 2 difference crystalline amorphous solids singh, 2020. thus, amorphous solids found solid material subsets. common reallife applications amorphous solids include transparent glasses, manufacturing polymeric structural materials, amorphous semiconductors used electronics, magnetic amorphous solids used making storage devices. polymeric structural materials polystyrene amorphous solids significant lightweight structural elements widely used automobile, aerospace, construction sectors. conclusion amorphous solids atomic structure disorganized characterized qualities shortrange order, lack sharp melting point, isotropic, indefinite heat fusion, show rough irregular surfaces cut two. beyond ordered materials understanding catalytic sites amorphous solids.
