references introduction spillways structures constructed control flooding provide safe paths releasing waters floods dams downstream. spillway clear water large amounts without causing form damage dam surrounding structures ensuring reservoir levels reach maximum gayar, 2020. figure 2 design ogee spillway methodology principles objective creation scale 120 spillway containing structure stilling basin. negligible differences achieved different scenarios prove tool used design spillway stilling basin effective. calculations proved stilling basin raised 0.603m achieve desired 2m water tail hence, insufficient accommodate hydraulic jump. placed basin hydraulic jump dissipated energy created water crushed them. conclusion proved design calculations, stilling basin 16m length. results model test show stilling basin spillway design perform effectively. model testing assured theory design stilling basin due incorporation hydraulic jump.
