concept underlying science hyperloop research paper introduction hyperloop transportation system high speed accelerates highspeed pods lowpressure tube. 1 hyperloop design hypothetical benefits hyperloop technology energy generation operations, low power requirements, rapid speed, lack crashes, immunity weather, mention gray, 2013, p. concept design hyperloop 2012 initial proposal elon musk, engineers tesla motors spacex worked together informally almost year around nine months. 2 mounted solar panel outside hyperloop tube 2016, two major competing companies came different proposals bringing reality concept designing hyperloop. space x company, owned elon musk, announced open competition independent engineering teams university students develop best design build effective efficient hyperloop pod. created innovative pod employed design utilizing magnetic levitation using air cushioning reduce friction pods. linear induction series motors would employed hyperloop pod achieve proposed los angelessan francisco 35 minutes trip accelerate pod nearly speed sound approximately 760 mileshour. propelling pods vacuum hyperloop tube scientific challenge facing hyperloop reducing large friction caused air hyperloop moving tube. aerodynamics designing pods aerodynamics vital even hyperloop tubes operate low pressure. addition, material costs kept down, implies area crosssection hyperloop pod hyperloop tube close other. addition, according elon musk, design hyperloop designed passengers experience 0.5g inertial acceleration maximum. notably, pods design used hyperloop, yet finished.
