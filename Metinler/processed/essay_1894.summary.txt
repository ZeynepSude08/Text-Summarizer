well known dna consists four nucleotides a, t, g, cd, every three variations nucleotides create particular amino acid. two nucleotides enough coding, change number monomers forming dna, would result 42 variants 16, exactly four times less. addition, genetic code degenerate, means amino acid encoded several codons once. reasonable conclusion drawn dna 70 gc require higher temperatures break entire molecule, contrast dna almost 1.6 times lower proportion g cd nucleotides.
