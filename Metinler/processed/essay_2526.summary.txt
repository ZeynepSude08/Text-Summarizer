however, inability control stressor reduce prefrontal cortexs capacity regulate stress responses. exposure stress escalates firing locus coeruleus leading increased release norepinephrine. exposure stress noticeably weakens effectiveness prefrontal cortex stimulating primitive responses amygdala rapid firing noradrenergic. acute stress weakens prefrontal cortex functions working memory. increased dopamine levels stimulate d1 receptors present prefrontal cortex impairing working memory. norepinephrine released stressful conditions, levels dictate molecular switch, determines whether prefrontal cortex engaged impaired.
