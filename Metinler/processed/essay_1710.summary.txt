difficulties assess risk terms tectonic hazards many factors hamper shortterm forecasting mass movement events. hydrological conditions heavy precipitation forecast confidence, warnings issued areas susceptible mass movement processes caused conditions earthquakes tectonics, hazard risk mitigation, 2017, p.205. mass movement hazards slope stability, role gravity, role water main force responsible movement mass gravity. triggering events related potential mass movement event mass movement event occur time slope becomes unstable. mass movement hazard predictions understanding slope stability triggering events slopes subject dangers mass movement triggering event. thus, slopes must assessed potential threat mass movement.
