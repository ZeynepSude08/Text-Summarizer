calculating number balloons 4. present work assumes even large building lifted air using large number balloons. key focus mathematical essay determine minimum number balloons lift building air consider associated features event. calculating number balloons basic idea balloons work intuitively obvious greater number balloons used, easier lift heavy object. diagram relationship mass lifted weight g diameter balloon last action calculations one easiest. since clear one balloon lift mass 12.4 g, difficult determine theoretical number balloons would required lift entire skyscraper. calculations shown detail equation 7 put another way, simulations showed would take 40 billion mediumsized balloons lift burj khalifa skyscraper using balloons. number balloons needed lift skyscraper depending size finally, one calculate economic benefit event using input cost one latex balloon right size sold amazon.
