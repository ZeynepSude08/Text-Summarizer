instances attributed stability dna due high g c content base pairing hydrogen bonds. high stability raises melting temperatures high g c content dna imminently requires higher temperatures denaturation bonds long time achieve process effectively. therefore, factors high g c content composition longer polynucleotide chains require higher denaturation temperatures compared low g c content dna samples.
