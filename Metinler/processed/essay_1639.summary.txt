getting vessel alongside berth type hull several vessel kinds exist, numerous ship hull varieties. ship boat hulls come various shapes sizes, including flatbottomed, roundbottomed, vshaped, multihulled hulls collas et al., 2018. figure 1 flatbottomed hull ballasted oil tanker general use helm power change direction described vessels intrinsic capacity alter course path. types engines engine used determined size effectiveness vessel tanker. currently, huge ships propelled different engines include slowspeed crosshead turbines, fourstroke motors, twostroke engines, mediumspeed, trunk gearboxes. type propellers propellers incredibly beneficial boat tanker responsible vessels propulsion. context vessel rudders, constructed differently depending various parameters, including hull shape, turbine configuration, speed, hydrodynamics, structural arrangement stern. slow speed control, use engines rudder ships velocity affected combination elements, including engine turbine. finally, propeller also critical speed control, therefore, type amount rudder utilized affects boats propulsion.
