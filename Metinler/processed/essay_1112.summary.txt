streaked organism incubated 37 0 c next lap period prepare bacteria biochemical tests. unknown 43, following tests performed gram stain, thioglycolate, oxidase, catalase, citrate, indole production, ornithinedecarboxylase test. unknown 15, tests performed gram stain, thioglycolate, oxidase, catalase, onpg bgalactosidase, indole production. gram stain test began bacterial smear fixed heating inoculated slide containing colony bacteria culture small volume water. oxidase test performed inoculating bacteria culture onto oxidase disc upon kovacs reagent added top, observation made color changes. test conducted streaking bacteria onto tsa slant growing 37 0 c 48 hours, hydrogen peroxide added. citrate test done streaking slant back forth light inoculum containing bacterial colony incubated aerobically 37 0 c 96 hours beaman et al., 2007. indole production test performed first growing organism using tryptophan medium beaman et al., 2007. test conducted putting inoculum culture 43 aseptically ornithine decarboxylase broth incubated 48 hours 37 0 c observation made color changes. upon completing experimental tests, unknown organisms identified following pcrblast, dichotomous keys using bergeys whitman et al., 2016, streak plate isolation, biochemical tests. unknown organism 15, gram stain, thioglycolate test, oxidase test, indole production negative, positive catalase test onpg bgalactosidase test. identify identity unknown organism, test results followed using dichotomous key, identified unknown organism 15 c. test result organism 15 name test observation interpretation gram stain color changed pink. oxidase test color change culture absence aerobic bacteria catalase test production bubbles organisms produce catalase enzymes break hydrogen peroxide. result unknown organism 43 negative gram stain, thioglycolate test, oxidase test, positive result observed catalase test. test result organism 43 name test observation interpretation gram stain color changed pink. oxidase test color change culture absence aerobic bacteria catalase test production bubbles organisms produced catalase enzymes break hydrogen peroxide. citrate test color change absence enzyme citrate permease organism indole production formation pink color production tryptophanase enzyme reacted kovacs reagent ornithinedecarboxylase test medium changed color yellow purple. existence indole biochemical test exhibited release tryptophanase enzyme bacteria, showed pink color settled medium added kovacs reagent 43.
