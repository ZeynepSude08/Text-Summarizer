general, cost positive integer describes complexity representing positive integer data set sum product smaller numbers set. creating cost function positive integer, cm , calhoun used following considerations or, one line m1 based 5, easy conclude value positive integer determined least two operations, whether summation multiplication. consequently, since one two operations finite number smaller numbers must applied identify conditional third term data set, calhoun function recursive avu. thus, set binary operations positive integer , exists calhoun function c mm 7 words, computed value positive integer always numerically equal smaller positive integer itself, extremely important consequence calhoun model. another critical consequence follows number operations finite, c evaluable function, unlike kolmogorov complexity string. additional consequences fact, positive integer cost function described previous section multivalued mathematical model several valuable conclusions drawn. hence, now, precisely known calhoun model uses either multiplication addition variations binary operations, cost function positive integer applying either operations whose result numerically smaller. example positive integer cost functions numbers 1 10. kolmogorov complexity one phenomenon general case, model shows impossibility computing program could define minimally compressed model fully encodes information.
