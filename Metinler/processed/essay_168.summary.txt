among named processes, dielsalder reaction, diene synthesis, traditionally used produce stereospecific sixmembered carbon cycles multiple bonds, excellent research popularity. however, basis remained unchanged namely, addition dienophile diene 2,4conjugation allows preparation nonaromatic homocyclic one multiple bonds them. procedure present diene synthesis reaction, butadiene sulfone used produce conjugated diene system heated.
