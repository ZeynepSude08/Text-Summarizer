pressure injury defined localized skin tissue damage caused pressure shear alotaibi et al., 2019. example, cochrane review demonstrated high efficacy using specialized mattresses preventing pressure injuries, insufficient evidence benefit pressure relief, nutritional support, dressing bony prominence, skin moisturizers alotaibi et al., 2019. review aims uncover importance implementing evidencebased interventions pressure injury prevention bundles reducing pressure rates critical care units. european pressure ulcer advisory panel describes six stages pressure injuries gupta et al., 2020. bundle approach proven effective method reduce prevalence pressure injuries critical care unit patients courtwright et al., 2017. moreover, four approaches reduce severity pressure injuries, recommended international pressure ulcer guidelines, include prophylactic dressing, silklike textiles, electrical muscle stimulation, microclimate, controlling temperature humidity skin romanelli et al., 2018. implementation bundle critical care, surgical, stepdown units resulted significant reduction occurrence pressure ulcers rivera et al., 2020. specifically, index healthcareassociated pressure injuries, proportion patients pressure ulcers days spent hospital, dropped 3.4 0.48 rivera et al., 2020. moreover, fouryear quality improvement study demonstrated 63 reduction prevalence pressure ulcers hospitals introducing bundle approach richardson et al., 2017. another study, conducted saudi arabia, showed 83 drop hospitalacquired pressure injuries 12 weeks implementation method alotaibi et al., 2019. moreover, optimizing patients health boosting immune status essential pressure injury prevention romanelli et al., 2018. conclusion summarize, prevention bundle pressure injuries critical approach reducing pressure ulcers incidence critical care units.
