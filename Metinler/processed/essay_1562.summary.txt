reference list summary viruses microorganisms survive reproduce cells organisms and, such, infect wide range living entities, bacteria plants, animals, humans. according classification, viruses grouped kind cells infect. viruses received increased attention academic community since understanding bacteriophage functioning lead usage human diseases treatment alternative antibiotics. instance, t4 bacteriophage attaches either ompc protein lipopolysaccharide surface escherichia coli bacteria brzozowka et al. bacteria, bacteriophages follow lysogenic life cycle impact cell genome case lysogenic conversion occurs. 7. lytic cycle consists four steps, namely bacteriophage attachment, bacterial cell penetration, replication, release. consequence, newly formed bacteriophages leave bacterium continue infecting healthy cells. chemical helps cell penetration infection spread process also facilitates lysis associated release newly formed viruses.
