led development milk devices aid farmers dairy factories process preserve product. background dairy plants evolved use equipment facilitates processes like milk manufacturing, pasteurizing, packaging, storing, transportation. improved dairy farming since plants manage process amount milk produced. around 1917, private dairy farmers presented milk products consumers locations rankin et al., 2017. current technology scientists technologists working improve milk processing procedure content products. current knowhow used aimed lowering cost, increasing shelf life, separating component products milk akbar et al., 2020. current technologies used milk processing plant discussed below. milk processing plants use midinfrared examination method determine composition product akbar et al., 2020. analysis process, sample milk products taken analyzed infrared technology determine content moisture milk powder, bulk, temperature shinde et al., 2018. also enables dairy farmers eliminate threat bacteria present milk products. types equipment dairy milk dairy pasteurizers equipment used heat dairy products considerable temperature suitable killing pathogens might present milk. dairy separator equipment used dairy farmers milk processing plants separate skimmed milk cream. increase effectiveness processing milk enables farmers reduce cost. machine makes easier dairy farmers lower labor different composition milk products. researchers agriculturalists studies different combinations feeds would improve quality milk products minimize industrial processes complicate process capstaff miller, 2018. constant rise need milk dairy products, made farmers actively involved using modern equipment sustain supply. technology made easier dairy farmers handle large volume milk time.
