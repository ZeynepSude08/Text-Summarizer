references magnetic resonance imaging technology one valuable technologies significantly benefit people magnetic resonance imaging mri. kose 2021 states mri first proposed 1973 lauterbur, presented crosssectional image water protons two test tubes nuclear magnetic resonance. exceptionally clear mri images obtained result study allow doctors see even minimal tumors small inflammatory processes tissues containing water. mri makes possible deeply examine data diseases get comprehensive study based images isin et al., 2016. accumulated clinical data obtained half century using mri allows people interpret image characteristics high accuracy identify pathologies cannot determined using diagnostic methods. magnetic resonance imaging also contraindicated patients nonremovable dentures. addition, principle ct based xrays, harm body, mri creates layered image organs tissues. magnetic resonance imaging safe, noninvasive method imaging soft tissue structures. duration obtaining standard mri image today also great inconvenience patients. conclusion conclusion, magnetic resonance imaging device significant necessary monitoring populations health.
