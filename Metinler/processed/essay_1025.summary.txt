rate essentially refers speed enzyme catalyzation, leads reaction resulting substrate turning product. factors influence rate enzyme activity include enzyme concentration, substrate concentration, proton concentration ph, well temperature. factors affect rate enzyme activity remain same, increasing initial concentration going result proportional rise enzymecatalyzed reactions initial velocity. reaction, enzyme possesses active site substrate bind to, occurs one two ways. noncompetitive inhibition, hand, imply active competition substrate inhibitor since latter binds regions enzyme, rather active site. cases, reaction substrate enzyme disrupted due inhibitor altering structure shape enzyme molecule, making active site useless. enzyme .
