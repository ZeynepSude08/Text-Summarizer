in this regard, the effect of the combination of vancomycin powder and dilute povidoneiodine lavage on reducing pji in patients at high risk of arthroplasty was examined.
therefore, a clinically relevant study of relatively reduced risk in pji should be considered when widely used, especially in centers with high infection rates.
the article describes the need to reduce postoperative complications by preventing infections by involving patients in understanding and targeted action on actual and potential risk factors.
additionally, awareness can help improve infection prevention among patients with risk factors.
however, the risk of infections is one of the most severe complications in joint replacement.
infections that complicate joint arthroplasty suggest the validity of risk factors and categories by the nnis index as a way to predict ssi.
