the current paper provides evidence that climate change is a problem mainly caused by human activity, which has a tremendous impact on the whole ecosystem despite the existing skepticism.
in this regard, the majority of people believe that such abnormal temperature changes are strongly associated with human activity.
however, some minority groups consider that global warming is a natural process that occurs regardless of human activity or argue that there is no climate change at all.
the central problem that causes global warming is the increased greenhouse gases such as methane, co2 carbon dioxide, and n2o nitrous oxide due to human activity.
despite the fact that the majority of scientists who study climate change advocate for the necessity of immediate actions, some skeptics argue against the need for human beings to solve the temperature increase.
additionally, certain people maintain that it is false to consider the current temperature rise abnormal or believe that there is no global warming at all.
overall, the current paper analyzed the causes and consequences of global warming and presented possible solutions to this issue.
moreover, it was shown why most of the global warming skeptics are mistaken and that there is indeed abnormal climate change caused by humans.
