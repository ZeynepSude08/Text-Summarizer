in particular, the peppered moth is thought to have changed its coloration qualitatively as a result of the deleterious effects of the industrial revolution on the forest.
as a consequence, lightcolored moths could no longer survive against the dark background of the bark, leading to the need for an evolutionary change in coloration to conceal dark.
kettlewells hypothesis is that if dark moths have an advantage in forests subjected to industrialization, such moths will have less advantage over predators in light trees.
in particular, animal coloration is a predictor of survival because light moths survived on a light background and dark moths survived on a dark background of tree bark.
