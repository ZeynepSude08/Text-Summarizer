the scientific revolution from astronomy to physics essay
the scientific revolution, which occurred roughly between the 15th and 16th centuries, refers to a period of innovations in science and technology, the entirety of which had originated from the notion that the earth is not at the center of the universe.
nicolaus copernicus, an astronomer of polish descent, is rightfully considered the first to introduce some of the key ideas, which would later evolve into the fullfledged scientific revolution.
as scientists fought for the validity of copernicanism, a series of important discoveries were made in the field of physics, prompting the scientific revolution to expand beyond astronomy.
