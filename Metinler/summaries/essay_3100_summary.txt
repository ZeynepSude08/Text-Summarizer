as a result, this paper deliberates the importance of mandating the covid19 vaccine to health care works.
if health care workers appear to recommend vaccines for others while avoiding them for themselves, public confidence will be eroded.
therefore, all health care personnel should be given the covid19 vaccination, which would otherwise encourage the general public to get vaccinated.
vaccinating health care workers against covid19 is not new instead, it is a continuation of longestablished procedures and policies.
having more workers vaccinated and fewer workers out recovering from covid19 will also alleviate pressure on workers, enhancing the health care workforces adaptability.
again, vaccination among health care workers should be mandated since the availability of the vaccine is limited.
while campaigns for mandatory covid19 vaccine to health care workers may have significant benefits, it has encountered notable opposition.
therefore, it is morally acceptable to require that health care workers be vaccinated willingly and follow all other disease prevention measures.
mandating covid19 vaccination for health care workers.
