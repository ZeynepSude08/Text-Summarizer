the topic i would like to discuss is the impact of social media on children.
it can be formulated as follows the fear of mission out syndrome and its psychological impact on childrens personality development.
therefore, the syndrome of missing out is one of the most dangerous social mediainvolving threats for children.
the psychological and social training should be updated to prepare children to cope with the syndrome of missing out.
