2. how many species of birds exist
4. the species of birds altitude
consequently, the following research aims to assess the bird species globally, the birds hearing frequencies, the species of birds altitude, and current technology that deters birds in airports and planes.
according to most scorecards used by bird watchers and scientists, there are approximately 9,000 to10, 000 birds species van gasteren et al., 2019, p.
another study conducted by princeton university professionals found approximately 9,700 bird species globally, though this figure is debatable miek and blicharzdomaska, 2018, p.
according to birdlife.org, the world is home to nearly 11,000 different bird species miek and blicharzdomaska, 2018, p.
although responsiveness to frequencies below 20 hz sound has attracted great attention, bird species have demonstrated physiological zeyl et al., 2020 and behavioral reactions to these low frequencies.
within the 1  4 khz range, the frequency of institutional racism in birds is only around half or onethird as effective as in human beings zeyl et al., 2020, p.
consequently, auditory alerts must be at frequency bands detectable by the damaged auditory receptors to disperse birds using sound accurately zeyl et al., 2020.
the species of birds altitude
scott wrote that a multitude of bird species navigate at even high elevations conkling et al., 2018.
scott emphasizes that birds such as hummingbirds and sparrows exist in heights of 16,404 ft 5,000 m in the alpine region conkling et al., 2018, p.
