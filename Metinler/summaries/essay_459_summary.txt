unfortunately, few studies have tried to observe the discrepancy in media freedom between china and taiwan and the challenges that chinese press freedom faces.
the topic is particularly timely given the current state of freedom in china, particularly liberty in the way media operates.
a potential limitation is the media selection in this case, the researcher selected three significant media sources in china and taiwan.
there is a large body of literature in the field of freedom of the press investigations, media freedom in china, and press freedom and human rights studies.
the goal is to contribute to the study of chinese media freedom by using news stories as a lens that portrays the broad current occurrence of press freedom in china.
although the analysis results do not fully reflect the status of chinas entire media due to sample size limitations, the study can provide some proof that press freedom in china is severely restricted.
