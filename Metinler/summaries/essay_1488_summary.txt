at a certain point in the play, happy speaks to his brother the words that his father repeats all the time.
however, the eldest son of a salesman is not as convinced of his fathers words as his brother happy, and for several reasons.
biff and happy had already booked a table in advance at the restaurant where they and their father would celebrate their older brothers hiring.
biff does not want to live among deceptive illusions like a father but hopes to find his place in the world indeed.
brother biff seems to be repeating the fate of his father  he builds castles in the air, hoping that optimism and a whitetoothed smile will lead to wealth and success thanks to a human attitude.
happy asks biff to lie to his father, to say that oliver recognized him, received him well, and was delighted that the man was returning to his work.
all of this goes against the convictions of wellliked willy, so poor and broken in his aspiration to be liked by everyone, and this becomes the end of his selfdeception for biff, just as death is the end for his father.
for biff, this may be the beginning of a new life without the burden of his fathers trauma, and for willy, it is the total of a boys life without a father and without a brother whom he had hoped for.
