a story written in 1927 called hills like white elephants is an example of such a work.
hemingway uses symbolism in his works to hide the obvious by making the reader think.
thus, hemingway does not need to tell the story of what happened because the symbolism does that on its own.
in the story hills like white elephants , it becomes apparent that dialogue and symbolism are central to the writers work.
in addition, hemingway hardly ever comments on what is happening readers either understand it themselves or are told by the symbols.
