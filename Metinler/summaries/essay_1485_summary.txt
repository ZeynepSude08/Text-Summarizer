in this report, the framework of three staining procedures for several bacterial and spore lines, covering the differential needs of microbiological analysis, is explored in detail.
safranin contrast staining was used for the cooled bacterial smear to ensure that the smear was fixed with new pigment.
red carbolicfuchsin was then used to stain the bacterial suspension for several minutes, after which the excess pigment was washed off.

bacterial staining solves many problems associated with simplified observation of cells using a microscope.
it is well known that the murein layer of the cell membrane of gram bacteria is much thicker, which allows purple staining to initially fix, unlike gram bacteria, whose polysaccharide shell is much thinner.
in other words, it is possible to use this method to identify those bacteria that can exist under extremely low ph conditions and do not respond to basic staining techniques, including gram staining aryal, 2018.
