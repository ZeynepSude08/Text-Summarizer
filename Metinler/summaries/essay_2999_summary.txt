the salespeople collected price data on 1001 real estate properties in the region to test whether the average price differs from the stated average.
the objective of this test is to determine if the average sales price for the real estate prices differs from the estimated value of 275.
from figure 1, it is clear that the average price of real estate prices has a positive skew.
most of the real estate properties had an average price ranging from 200400 per square foot.
nonetheless, the distribution approximated a bellshaped curve, and a normal probability test could be conducted to determine if the actual average price differed from the hypothesized difference.
therefore, the average house prices are higher than 275 per square meter, and the advertisement should not be posted, as it will present a wrong assumption on the average cost of housing.
in conclusion, a onetailed test for the average house prices showed that the hypothesized price of the house was higher than the actual average.
the test, which was conducted at 5 level of significance, showed that the average house prices were lower than the hypothesized value of 275 per square meter.
