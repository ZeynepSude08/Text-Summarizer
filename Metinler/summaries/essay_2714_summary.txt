the conflict that led to the civil war was between the fourth rashidun caliph ali and muawiya, the syrian governor.
the umayyads criticized the transfer of power with muawiya and other muslims seeking vengeance from the caliph.
this paper will deeply analyze the causes of the civil war between ali and muawiya that led to the most crucial battle in the history of islam.
the prolonged armed struggle between ali and muawiya was rooted in history from the hashemites and the umayyads dynasties.
the umayyads rejected this decision, and muawiya began to criticize alis leadership for making it difficult for the administration to thrive.
in conclusion, the islamic civil war resulted from leadership struggles and succession controversies between the umayyads and the hashemites dynasties.
after the death of uthman, ali was elected to take over the caliphate decision that was under pressure and led to rebels from the umayyads.
the authorities of medina were gripped with fear and wanted a caliph who would protect them from the wrath faced by muawiya, which led to them persuading the reluctant ali to take over leadership.
the battle occurred in the arabian peninsula between 656 and 661 and ended with muawiyas troops overthrowing ali and establishing the umayyad dynasty.
