the first company that provides information about the development of a strategy for international markets is media beacon .
i agree with the information provided on the site since the company itself has success in the international market of developing marketing strategies and can give good advice on development.
me as a student, these sites were helpful and gave me an idea of building a strategy aimed at entering the companys international market.
