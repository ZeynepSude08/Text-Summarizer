ethics of security measures in the netherlands essay
the case of security measures in the netherlands poses a great ethical dilemma especially to the authorities who may be tasked with the responsibility of securing the nation.
this is because there is difficulty in choosing the best option between all the available choices to the minister of security and justice, ferdinand grapperhaus who approves or rejects the request of security services.
as the minister for both security and justice, grapperhaus has either to accept a request which might infringe on the rights of citizens or disallow the application therefore exposing the same nationals to security threats.
from the second order ethics, it is also obscure as to why accepting the security requests might be immoral or not and if that is the case then the reasons for declaring it unethical or otherwise.
clearly, this is a moral dilemma because either the choices made by grapperhaus will automatically raise some ethical questions.
in consideration of the dilemma faced by grapperhaus, one can apply ethical current such as utilism .
the ethical proposition of utilism otherwise referred to as utilitarianism was formulated by a remarkable english legal theorist, jeremy bentham.
as such, the benthams ethical theory of utilism is based on analysis of happiness as a balance of pleasure over pain.
the first option is to accept aivd and mivd requests to intercept communications of the citizens as they are being secured.
when the case of netherlands minister of security and justice is evaluated, the first plan under ci would be to propose a course of action to take with regards to either of the two options.
similarly, the virtue ethics would make me settle on security first because the law allows innocents citizens whose information has been tapped to lodge their complaints.
