the artistic, creative process that leads to the creation of pieces of visual art is the engine for generating ideas.
this combination, in my opinion, allows the artist to create a valuable piece of visual art.
when creating a piece of visual art, i always think about what feelings it can evoke in the viewer.
i believe this is the main purpose of creating visual art and the source of my artistic ideas.
