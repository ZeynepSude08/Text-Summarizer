this study is needed because if individuals can go back to work or school as long as childcare is free, then it is important that the government finds ways to provide this for the people and reduce unemployment rate.
there have been studies before that have tried to determine the reasons behind low employment rates as well as individuals failing to complete school brewer, cattan, crawford et al., 2021.
this research addresses the relationship between low employment rate and affordability of childcare which has not been made clear by the previous studies.
the relationship between the affordability of childcare and dropout, as well as turnover cases, cannot be studied in the way the past researchers have attempted to do brewer, cattan, crawford et al., 2021.
researching if free childcare can help reduce the unemployment rates and school dropout cases is important because the country is struggling to find ways to lower the unemployment rates.
