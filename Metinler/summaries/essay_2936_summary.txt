the problem of child aggression and aggressive behavior requires an immediate and urgent solution.
if earlier it was about the initial manifestations of aggressiveness, mainly in adolescence, now this problem has become relevant for primary school, and the beginnings of militancy in childrens behavior are increasingly observed already in preschool age.
preventing aggressive behavior in preschool children
methods of preventing aggressive behavior in preschool children include play therapy, projective drawing, doll therapy, music therapy, and dance therapy.
play therapy is a method of correcting emotional disorders, as well as behavioral disorders in children.
projective drawing is currently used to prevent and correct psychological problems in children, which may be associated with increased aggressive behavior and various conflicts.
music therapy is a method of working with preschool children using music in any form.
music therapy is actively used to prevent and correct aggressive behavior, emotional deviations, motor and speech disorders, psychosomatic diseases, fears, behavioral variations, communication difficulties, etc.
dance therapy can prevent aggressive behavior, anxiety, tension, neurosis, and other emotional disorders in children.
usually, with the assimilation of rules and norms of behavior, the direct manifestations of child aggression give way to prosocial forms of behavior.
