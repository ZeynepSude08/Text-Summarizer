cliches and stereotypes about older adults in advertising cause negative attitudes in people as they present unrealistic and outoftouch messages to the audience.
this stereotypical video is ageist because it supports bias and discrimination against older workers, people struggling financially, and the elderly in general.
another example of ageism is an advertisement, dear young people, dont vote, where older adults urge the youth not to vote nail communications, 2018.
