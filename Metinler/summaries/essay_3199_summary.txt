weeks 1012 cover contrasting topics, but they are significantly related to materials we have studied before  ethical considerations, the concept of counterfactual, research design, and other issues.
topics discussed below include qualitative research tools, causal inference and counterfactuals, and randomized assignment.
selecting tools for evaluation, considering the fundamental problem of causal inference, and working with the sample in the first stages significantly influence the studys success, which justifies their importance.
as we identified in the first two weeks, two data types are used to answer specific evaluation questions  quantitative, transmitted through measurements and numbers, and qualitative, presented through language.
the need for qualitative data and, therefore, the use of qualitative tools may arise when the focus of the evaluation is the experience of research participants edep 657, 2021a.
at the same time, sampling strategies also differ  the evaluator can set a specific criterion for selecting participants or, conversely, include the possible number.
in detail, assessing the causal effect means comparing the average result of a group of individuals who participated in the program with a counterfactual  the average result of the group that did not participate edep 657, 2021b.
at the time we studied the ethical considerations of evaluations, we encountered randomized assignment.
such features provide significant benefits of using randomized assignment for research, programs, and evaluations.
in particular, the choice of qualitative tools that include methods for collecting data presented through language rather than measurement depends on the studys objectives and intended users.
when the evaluation focuses on establishing causal relationships, it is vital to consider the fundamental problem of causal inference and select counterfactual relevant for the study.
