however, as per the bible, gods presence and his divine attributes are evident from the act of the creation itself, despite the fact that humans distort their knowledge of the lord due to their sinful nature.
both the old testament and the new testament proclaim gods eternal power and divine nature suggesting that unbelief is irrational since there is no basis for doubting the existence of the superior creator rom.
in my view, people who seek to live a godlier life would turn to and interpret the scripture itself, while contemporary theology comprises a broad range of questions and considers different viewpoints on the lord and his attributes.
some people have a misconception of the divine attributes due to the difference in interpretation however, both moral and nonmoral concepts of the almightys nature are critical to consider for a better understanding of this doctrine.
the moral attributes of god derive from his divine holiness and absolute purity.
as stated by feinberg, the moral attributes of god are his holiness, righteousness, love, grace, mercy, longsuffering, goodness, lovingkindness, and truth.
god in christianity is the guardian of the moral world order whose acts derive from his holiness, love, and commitment to justice.
by asserting the almightys triune nature, christianity proclaims the existence of only one god while recognizing the father, the son, incarnate as jesus, and the holy spirit as three persons in one.
the scripture provides an idea of the conception of the universe and manifests the lords sixday creation culminating in a day of the divine respite as the model for people to build their workweek resulting in sunday as the holy day of rest.
gods attributes such as love, truth, righteousness, justice, and wrath do not suggest that these qualities are comparable with human traits.
9 therefore, the doctrine of providence should be viewed with regard to the eternal divine attributes that manifest gods omnipotence.
