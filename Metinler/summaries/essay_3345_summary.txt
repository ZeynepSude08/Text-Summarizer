integrated ocean drilling program expedition 342 term paper
drilling deeply into the seabed has expanded our knowledge of the function of fluid movement through ocean sediments and foundation bedrock, particularly how hydrogeological processes are linked inside the seafloor board, 2011.
drilling the tectonic drifts, particularly, would be excellent for further expeditions since the sequences allow cores of sedimentation to be deposited at significantly higher rates and offset shallow penetration locations.
the groundwater locations were drilled on janomaly ridge, the place where the process met a carbonaterich cretaceous to paleocene sequence overlain by a clayrich eocene to lower miocene sequence expedition 342 scientists, 2012, p.32.
such sedimentation is usually characterized as the beginning of drift depositing, occurred in the earlymid eocene across the areas of both janomaly ridge and southeast newfoundland ridge expedition 342 scientists, 2012 figure 3.
at last, a correlation of the drilling findings with seismographic formations from the southeast newfoundland ridge reveals wide geographical changes in the period and depth of silt drift packages, implying that the region is a potential platform for prospective explorations designed to restore highdeposition rate data from several areas of the cenozoic.
thus, without the utilization of modern technologies and ocean drilling, findings from expedition 342 could not be recovered.
the expedition showed that such findings could be provided only by ocean drilling, which aids the determination of sediments age.
