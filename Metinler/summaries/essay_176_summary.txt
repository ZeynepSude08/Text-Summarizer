both christianity and postmodern relativism relate to spirituality and its influence on human life.
christianity authors the belief in the existence of a sovereign god who controls everything in the universe, allowing and disallowing life events.
they explain the purpose, truth, and meaning of human life, influencing how christians perceive health care.
dependence on the allpowerful external force enables christians to reach a transcendent state for health care experiences and other life events.
scientism argues that hard sciences provide superior scientific knowledge as the only source of genuine and absolute truths.
overall, scientism accords greater intellectual authority to hard over soft sciences in knowledge matters.
therefore, the sciences cannot provide absolute facts and truths as knowledge grows with new information, creating no difference between hard and soft sciences.
however, the school environment and knowledge acquired in learning have opened up my thinking to become a more liberal christian.
my worldview aligns with the christianity definition that a supreme god created humans in his likeness to accomplish his purpose on earth.
human beings are stewards on earth, positioned by god to take care of animals, birds, and the environment they live in.
however, informal learning environments are often social groups where knowledge is unintentionally passed from one person to another.
