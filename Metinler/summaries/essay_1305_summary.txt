spending forty years in the wilderness was a punishment that god gave the israelites due to their unwillingness to take over the land of canaan.
the israelites took at least two months to travel from egypt to mount sinai, where moses was offered the ten commandments, approximately 8940 km.
mount sinai is 509 kilometers away from canaan, the israelites destination or promised land.
