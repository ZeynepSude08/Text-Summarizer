nicholas morton provides a convincing statement that the first crusade was not the reason to express hate towards muslims, it was an action towards turks religious beliefs and a consequence of a different perception of the enemy.
in crusader letters, it is also visible that the enemy is called turks as the group of the population without any religious context and referring to islam.
thus, the union of christian believers was major in the motivation of the crusaders, not the hatred towards islam.
despite the mentioned above argument, turks at the first crusades period represented a rapidly changing culture with flexible customs due to their lifestyle.
although the letters of the crusaders do not express judgment towards turks or islam, the majority of the letters highlight christianity and trust in gods will.
hence, morton in the article provides persuading arguments claiming the first crusade was not the reason to express hatred towards muslims.
