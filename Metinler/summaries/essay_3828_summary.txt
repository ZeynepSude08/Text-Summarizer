this expresses the necessity of preserving culture, as the loss of identity, language, and traditions are not limited to some parts of the world but occur among smaller groups worldwide.
the real question is whether certain groups or individuals are required to continue to practice the traditions, rituals, and values of their culture.
essentially, i believe that as many as possible traditions and artworks should be preserved from my heritage, but the practice of these things can be decided by members of my cultural group individually.
