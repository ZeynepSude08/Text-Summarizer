in short, according to the collision theory, the factors affecting reaction rates include collisions, orientation, and activation energy levels.
the method of active collisions does not explain the influence of the solvent, pressure, additions of inert gases, and other factors on the reaction rate gottfried 460.
however, the prime factors still remain relevant and critical for the predictive potential of the theory, which are collisions, orientation, and activation energy levels.
