among the named processes, the dielsalder reaction, or diene synthesis, traditionally used to produce stereospecific sixmembered carbon cycles with multiple bonds, is of excellent research popularity.
however, the basis has remained unchanged namely, the addition of a dienophile to a diene by 2,4conjugation allows the preparation of nonaromatic homocyclic with one multiple bonds in them.
for the present diene synthesis reaction, butadiene sulfone was used to produce a conjugated diene system when heated.
