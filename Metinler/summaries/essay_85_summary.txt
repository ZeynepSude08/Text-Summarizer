the proposed research aims to assess how neural stem cells replace and differentiate into neurons and other cells of the brain to use them for therapeutic purposes.
the source will be useful for exploring and discussing how neural stem cells can be used in practice since the study focuses on in vitro mechanisms.
the study focuses on two key neural stem cell pools in the mammalian brain the subventricular zone svz and dentate gyrus dg.
neural stem cells origin, heterogeneity and regulation in the adult mammalian brain.
the source provides insightful data on how neural stem cell pools are maintained throughout brain development and maturity.
the source is highly useful for the practical aspects of implementing neural stem cells antiaging properties in the human brain.
