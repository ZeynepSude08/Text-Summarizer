modern industrial farming techniques contribute to the fact that people tend to produce more food, creating abundance.
as has been mentioned above, implementing industrial improvements in farming resulted in essential costs.
consequently, the following paragraphs will introduce the most significant costs of modern farming techniques.
secondly, improved agricultural techniques result in the fact that more plants and animals are bred and consumed as food, which can be a problem from a moral point of view.
the narrative above demonstrates that modern farming techniques lead to an ethical issue.
consequently, another cost of industrial farming implies that modern people frequently face ethical dilemmas while choosing what attitude animals and plants deserve.
consequently, another cost refers to the fact that genetic engineering significantly impacts farming, and it is challenging or impossible to grow plants and animals without these elements in the future.
since the discussion above has demonstrated that modern industrial farming techniques are associated with high costs, it is reasonable to discuss possible alterations that can address them.
simultaneously, this scenario results in the fact that an ethical issue becomes evident because many experts admit that, for example, fishes and plants are emotional and intelligent.
another issue is associated with the fact that bioengineering agents and biopiracy can result in the fact that the land will become inadaptable for farming without additional chemicals.
secondly, it is also necessary to address an ethical issue because more and more experts admit that animals and plants are intelligible.
once implemented, these three steps will help make the farming industry the least problematic and costly for multiple stakeholders.
