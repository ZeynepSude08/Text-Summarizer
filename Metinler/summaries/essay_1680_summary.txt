the first analyzed article is predicting the direction of stock market index movement using an optimized artificial neural network model by mingyue qiu and yu song.
the use of innovative technologies, such as the optimized artificial neural network model ann, can improve the accuracy of the daily stock market index prediction qiu  song, 2016.
comparing their method with the previous studies, they conclude that the hybrid gaann model can be viewed as a potentially advantageous method to increase prediction accuracy and acquire better results qiu  song, 2016.
the authors state that artificial autonomous systems aas are widely used in various spheres to improve decisionmaking processes and attain better results cabrerapaniagua  rubilartorrealba, 2021.
applying the machine learning techniques considering stock price indices, it is possible to acquire a better vision of the current markets state and increase the accuracy of predictions and effectiveness of various operations lee et al., 2018.
