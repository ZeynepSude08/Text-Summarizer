this novel shows that the antiwar movement was primarily supported by the young citizens, while the politicians decided to use the national guard to suppress the protests.
on the other hand, some of these letters explain why despite the strong antiwar movement, some americans still supported the continuation of the war.
thus, these letters help one understand both sides of the debate and see how the antiwar movement has helped change the course of events in the vietnam war.
the fact that some americans supported the war in vietnam as they feared that this was the only way of stopping communism that could later affect the united states also shows why the antiwar movement emerged initially.
