the dispossessed is an anarchist utopian story written by ursula k.
shevek is declared a traitor twice first by the anarresti for deciding to leave their home planet and work in urras, and later by the urrasti for sharing his theory with all other nations le guin, 1994.
while anarresti feel shevek left them for his personal gain, urras, at the moment, appeared to have offered greater opportunities for research, which were intended to benefit everyone.
i think that the parallels between shevek and the creature from frankenstein are that both characters do not fit both worlds and fail to fit the paradigm of their respective societies.
