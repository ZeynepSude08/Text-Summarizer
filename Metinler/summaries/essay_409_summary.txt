according to kants philosophy, the distinction between a person and a thing runs through several basic criteria, largely related to independence and dignity.
at the same time, dignity is not only an internal concept since it is something that can be given by one person to another, such as respect or favor.
thus, the external dignity of a person comes from the field of social experience and the attitude of other people to a person, which is most valuable in bioethics and medical practice.
