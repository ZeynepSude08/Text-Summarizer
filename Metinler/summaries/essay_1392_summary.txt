intermodal transportation impacts on environment research paper
this research paper seeks to answer two important questions what are the benefits of intermodal transport, and how can this solution reduce negative impacts on the environment?
although almost all modes of transport contribute to the pollution of nature, and the use of vehicles is growing, intermodal transportation can actually benefit the environment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
consequently, using intermodal transportation not only allows to cut costs and reduce shipping time but also decreases harmful gas emissions, environmental pollution, and the general use of fossil fuels.
for instance, according to cie manufacturing n.d., the environmental protection agency states that using intermodal rail for transporting goods and products for distances longer than a thousand miles will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to sixtyfive percent para.
to draw a conclusion, one may say that intermodal transportation is the best modern decision that addresses environmental problems.
therefore, intermodal transportation appears to have an extended number of advantages, including reduced use of fossil fuels and decreased greenhouse gas emissions.
advantages and disadvantages of intermodal freight transportation.
