cultural sampling report on the perceptions of the word santeria report
this is the report on the interviews on peoples perceptions and knowledge on the city colleges of chicago campus on the culturespecific word santeria.
the methodology used in this project is the facetoface interview on whether the responders ever heard the word santeria .
these questions are relevant because they do not hint at the origin or cultural link of the word.
the three chosen interviews are from people of different ethnic origins, age groups, gender, and professional sphere.
however, the african american girl only noted that it sounds like an african word, maybe related to the ancient cultures.
some of them were able to identify the relation of the word to a cultural theme or hispanic origin, relying on the words sounding.
