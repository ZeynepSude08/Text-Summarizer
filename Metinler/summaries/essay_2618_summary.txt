consequently, this literature review will study these reasons and factors for the segregation of religious groups to examine the underlying scientific arguments and assess the level of knowledge of the topic in research circles.
other authors also use similar ideas in their articles to demonstrate the causes of religious segregation and explain its social factors.
hence, these findings demonstrate that religious segregation exists due to social factors, namely fear of external threats to the existence of the group.
consequently, this socialization pushes people to belong to a group and preserves religious segregation.
thus, the authors demonstrate that in both cases, religious segregation is shaped by the social environment, although the cultural context can diminish its negative impact if state policy promotes tolerance.
segregation also manifests itself within religious groups along racial lines, which has been studied by various authors, mainly in american society.
for example, cobb, skp, and jefferson 2017 study congregational characteristics associated with the racial attitudes of black churchgoers and note the significant impact of segregation in religious groups.
first, the authors note the peculiarities of the division of christian churches into predominantly black and predominantly white, which demonstrate the segregation factor in the religious society of the united states.
therefore, this literature review demonstrates that various scholars have explored the issue of the segregation of religious groups however, their approaches often do not include the study of the causes and factors of this phenomenon.
