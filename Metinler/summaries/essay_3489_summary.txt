cystic fibrosis cf occurs when a gene mutates in the cystic fibrosis conductance transmembrane regulator cftr, triggering the iteration in the bodys electrolyte transport system cells bergeron et al., 2019 715.
the most familiar symptoms attributed to the complication constitute thick mucus clogged within specific organs like the intestines, pancreas, and lungs young et al., 2019 227.
by being a multisystem health condition, cystic fibrosis affects several underlying organs within the body.
within the respiratory tract, the chloride channel present in several epithelial tissues, cftr protein, is encoded by the cftr gene bergeron et al., 2019 716.
the interference within the lung environment allows for bacterial growth in the biofilm growth mode, generating ideal conditions for protecting the bacteria against antibiotic actions and the host cells bergeron et al., 2019 720.
however, when the main branches of the lungs are affected by cf, they succumb to the sticky and thick mucus that prohibits the cilia from performing their responsibilities.
the mucus eventually builds up within the lungs resulting in a decline in lung function filbrun et al., 2016 97.
no cure exists for the management of cf, and the majority of the patients die between the ages of 20 and 30 years due to lung failure filbrun et al., 2016 63.
