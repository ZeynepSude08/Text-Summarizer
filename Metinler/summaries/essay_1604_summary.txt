technical drawings can be described as plans that show how a humanmade object is constructed.
a technical drawing is usually a diagram that illustrates an object from different angles projections to explain its structure fig.
figure 1 a technical drawing
computeraided design cad is software used to create digital technical drawings.
orthographic projection is used to represent a 3d object by using 2d drawings of its different viewpoints.
there are two types of orthographic projection  first and third angle  they differ only in the way of putting the views onto the drawing fig.
to draw a firstangle projection, one can imagine that the object is placed between the person drawing and the projection fig.
to distinguish the first angle projection, technical drawings are marked with a specific symbol fig.
5. on the technical drawing, the object is in the third quadrant, and the other views are placed in the first and second ones rahbarianyazd and nia, 2019.
while objects views are separated into sides in orthographic projections, axonometric projections display the plan, front, and side views in one drawing.
isometric projections are more common in technical drawings than in other axonometric types.

for example, a thin chain line represents the lines of symmetry in an object as well as the center and trajectory of the drawing saif, 2021.
for this reason, all technical drawings are drawn to a specific scale for producers to build the object according to its true dimensions tornincasa, 2020.
many types of scale exist, according to the drawings purpose and the measurement system used in the project.
