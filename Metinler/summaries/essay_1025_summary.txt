this rate essentially refers to the speed of enzyme catalyzation, which then leads to a reaction resulting in a substrate turning into a product.
some of the factors that influence the rate of enzyme activity include enzyme concentration, substrate concentration, proton concentration ph, as well as temperature.
if all the other factors that affect the rate of enzyme activity remain the same, increasing initial concentration is going to result in a proportional rise of the enzymecatalyzed reactions initial velocity.
in such a reaction, an enzyme possesses an active site for a substrate to bind to, which occurs in one of two ways.
noncompetitive inhibition, on the other hand, does not imply active competition between a substrate and an inhibitor since the latter binds to other regions of an enzyme, rather than an active site.
in other cases, the reaction of the substrate and the enzyme is disrupted due to the inhibitor altering the structure or shape of the enzyme molecule, making the active site useless.
