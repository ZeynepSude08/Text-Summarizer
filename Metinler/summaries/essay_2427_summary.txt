this project aims to assess and eventually implement a mobile electronic medical records emr system in the hospital.
the mobile emr can provide essential patient health data, vital signs, audiovisual and text communication, and integrated electronic health records allowing healthcare providers to monitor the status of patients in realtime.
a theoretical framework, adopted from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and the technology acceptance model, would then be implemented to assess the impact of adopting the mobile emr application and the intent of use for most of the healthcare providers.
in addition, by implementing the mobile emr system, there is the underlying ramification that the facility would be increasing the nodes of access to the emr infrastructure, increasing the risk of data breaches and other patientdata security threats enaizan et al., 2020.
existing service providers and contractors are providing robust mobile emr offerings that can be implemented in various facilities, with the option of continued support and updates at a considerably low cost.
2018 indicate that more often than not, the cost of implementation of an emr system within a healthcare facility is worth it  and even legally mandated in certain jurisdictions , considering the increasingly integral role that these technologies play in the provision of quality, consistent healthcare delivery.
healthcare delivery is optimized through delineating access to patient data and vital statistics, allowing easier access to structured information, and improving overall patient safety through decision support and better access to information by healthcare providers dagliati et al., 2021.
essentially, dematerialization is a significant advantage of computer technology however, the current iteration of emr, which leverages this technology, often decreases mobility by healthcare providers as they are tethered to computers in many clinical settings.
overall, implementing the mobile emr platform in this facility provides an opportunity to leverage current technologies for the vast improvement of patient outcomes and care delivery.
