when discussing parkinsons disease pd, the patients care, both from the community and healthcare professionals, is a concern.
my research concerning pd patients care continues as i found this article as important as the two discussed articles.
this articles main point is shifting care of the pd patients from hospitals to community care.
in doing so, caregivers and other healthcare professionals find it easy to care for patients with adverse pd conditions.
although the articles agree on some aspects concerning pd patient care, the second article dwells on the relationship between educating the public on pd and the burden of caregiving.
the finding showed that with education on the pd, patients receive quality care and reduce the burden on the caregivers side.
all in all, the information gained from these articles teaches the importance and the need for pd patients care.
the information contained in this article was objective and had a clear message concerning caring for the persons affected by pd and proved that caring for pd patients is a matter that deserves nursing attention.
thus, education programs on the disease improved the understanding of patients and caregivers of the pd and reduced the burden of care, and improved the quality of life among pd patients.
thus, as the article presents, pd care is a challenge to caregivers and the whole community as such, education on the disease must be a top priority to enhance the understanding of pd conditions.
