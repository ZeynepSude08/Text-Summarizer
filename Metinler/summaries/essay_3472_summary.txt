in the passage beginning on line 1480, oedipus addresses his children, disclosing the truth to them and wishing them a better life oedipus 127.
the passage also mentions how wretched and pitiful he must be to his childrens sight after they learn the truth of the incestuous relationship between their mother, jocasta, and father and halfbrother, oedipus.
thus, oedipus shows his love to his children by bestowing the gift of truth that he was denied.
the love oedipus as a father has for his children, who are also his halfsiblings, can be noted in him wishing them a better life than the one he was granted by fate.
although he wanted to kill his and their mother once he found out the truth about their relationship, oedipus never showed the same intentions toward his children in his last monologue.
