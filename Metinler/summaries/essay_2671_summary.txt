therefore, young clients belonging to lgbtq can be classified as higher risk cases since youth are already vulnerable to stb, and the sexual orientation factor creates additional danger.
the therapist must exercise special caution and delicacy while evaluating the factors related to the case and engaging the lgbtq client in the process of treatment.
eric, the client from the case example, has developed several warning signs attributed to his condition.
erics case is complicated by multiple risk factors, which might pose a challenge for the treatment process.
luckily for eric, several protective factors are present in his case, which can help win the time and improve his condition with treatment.
judging by the warning signs, risk factors, and protective factors present in the clients case, i believe that he presents risk only to himself.
eric had suicidal thoughts before the harsh treatment from his parents, who deprived him of financial support, can add extra stress.
otherwise, the clients suicidal thoughts might return, and his depression catalyzed by the lack of proper treatment and family support might cause him to commit suicide.
in erics case, the clients engagement in treatment is necessary for a successful outcome.
in addition, i would explain to eric that cams is helpful for understanding and prioritizing the most dangerous factors of his condition.
first of all, i would encourage eric to fill out a cams suicide status form ssf so that we could evaluate the risks of suicidal behavior as a team.
