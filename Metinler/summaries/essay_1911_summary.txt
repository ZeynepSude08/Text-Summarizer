2. vaccine priority groups during a pandemic
the purpose of this statement is to address other members of the task force to explore the principle of social worth and discuss who should be given priority when distributing vaccinations during a pandemic.
according to this principle, people involved in public health care and safety should be vaccinated first because they can benefit others and contribute to the overall good.
in particular, if health workers and people at greatest risk are not prioritized in vaccine distribution, a health care system collapse is likely to occur, with tremendous consequences to society as a whole.
while it is rarely argued that health care workers should not be prioritized, there is an ethical issue of vaccine administration for nonpriority occupations.
to conclude, the principle of social worth applied to vaccine distribution is based on utilitarianism, which refers to an ethical theory prioritizing the overall good for society.
according to this approach, it is essential to vaccinate frontline workers and vulnerable populations to overcome the covid19 pandemic.
