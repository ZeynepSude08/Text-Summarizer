review of christinas world paintings essay
andrew wyeths 1948 painting christinas world shows a young woman seen from her back, wearing a light pink dress, halflying or halfsitting in a grass field, seemingly looking at the farmhouse in the distance.
andrew wyeth was born in 1917 and died in 2009, so christinas world , which was painted in 1948, could be considered an early to midcareer piece.
the paintings imagery and composition were inspired by anna christina olson, who was a regular young woman.
