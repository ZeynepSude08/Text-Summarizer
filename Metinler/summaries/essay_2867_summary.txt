this paper attempts to research the two key unifying experiences of the african diasporas worldwide the history of racial oppression struggles and the shared cultural and artistic practices.
the purpose of the paper is to establish and discuss the key unifying experiences that are shared by the members of the african diaspora worldwide.
it is argued that racial oppression and prejudices and artistic and cultural practices form the two key pillars of the shared african diaspora experience.
the conceptual opposition between the diaspora members and the residents of the country theyve immigrated to creates their shared african identity, mending their cultures into the diaspora one.
culture for the diaspora members is personal and political to the same degree and is actively protected as a vital part of the african ethnic identity.
they indicate the cultural and spiritual unity that has originated between the diaspora members in their shared immigrational experience.
in the end, the african diaspora is united by their otherness compared to the national, cultural, and ethnic majorities in the countries it resides in.
one might argue, that this experience is not unique to the african diaspora, being instead adopted by different othered immigrant communities worldwide.
in conclusion, the cultural and historical heritage of the african diaspora provides a key to understanding their shared identity and position worldwide.
