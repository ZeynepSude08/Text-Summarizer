the cooling curves of the pure compounds and various mixtures were used to construct a solidliquid phase diagram of the biphenyl and naphthalene systems.
repeat the above step for 0.4g and another 0.4g of naphthalene to the biphenyl sample to obtain the cooling curve for each.
first, the cooling curves for all the nine mixtures were determined, and the results can be found in figures 1 and 2 for 2 grams of naphthalene  0.20.410.421 grams of biphenyl and 2 grams of biphenyl  0.20.410.42 grams of naphthalene accordingly.
next, to determine the mole fraction for both biphenyl and naphthalene solutions, it is necessary first to calculate the number of moles of each component in different samples using equation 3.
starting pure material   of the sample  i   naphthalene g  biphenyl g  naphthalene  biphenyl moles  mole fraction of naphthalene  x n   mole fraction of biphenyl  x b 
based on the received mole fraction rate and temperature values, it is possible to construct a phase diagram and identify the measured eutectic point in which solid and liquid phases are in thermodynamic equilibrium.
the next step was plotting the mole fraction of naphthalene and biphenyl against the depressed freezing point.
for instance, the melting point of pure naphthalene was 352.2 k, but when the 0.6 grams of biphenyl were added, the final solidification temperature was equal to 344.2 k.
according to previous research conducted by the national institute of standard and technology 2021a, 2021b, the melting points of pure biphenyl and naphthalene are 342.15 k and 353.15 k.
2010 determined that the eutectic temperature is 314.15 k while the composition of naphthalene to biphenyl is 40 against 60, respectively.
in summary, the current research presented the cooling curves of two pure chemical components, namely biphenyl and naphthalene, and their mixtures.
moreover, it intended to identify the melting points of each studied sample and based on this information, determine the eutectic composition and temperature.
it was found that the melting points for pure naphthalene and biphenyl are equal to 352.2 k and 340.2 k, respectively, which is almost in line with the generally accepted values.
