i demonstrated nonverbal communication during the conflict to illustrate my feelings.
this type of communication perfectly suits the conflict i experienced with the customer.
i showcased passiveaggressive communication to the customer by refusing to attend to his complaint and escaping his needs.
therefore, i could not communicate with the customer due to the pressure of attending to different orders of urgency.
reflection on this incident has helped me realize certain communication areas that i need to work on, rectify, and perfect.
changing my behavior will potentially benefit my future ability to develop effective communication with people, clients, and colleagues at the workplace.
for this reason, the development of effective communication will help to resolve conflicts that might arise in the future.
the two strategies i will employ to perfect my future communication shall be the development of assertiveness and training to become an active listener.
developing assertiveness and becoming active listener strategies are vital in managing conflicts and suit teamwork and collaboration in my future workplace.
