immigration in america originally began after the u.s. proclaimed independence however, a few laws were imposed to reduce the number of potential new settlers.
in addition, americans blamed chinese immigrants for low wages and the unemployment rate, which further influenced the ban on asians to move to the u.s. the new laws granted black people their freedom from slavery and were mainly related to chinese individuals.
to sum up, american congress then offered a lottery system to give green cards to illegal european immigrants that remained in the u.s. after their visas expiration.
