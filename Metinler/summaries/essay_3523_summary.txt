coming back to the discrimination in hiring processes, i find it inconsistent that the racial factor only contributes to the cases in which diverse candidates present competition to white counterparts.
another inconsistency in hiring discrimination is that both racial and ethnic factors could have a cumulative effect in combination with other factors.
in conclusion, i believe that inconsistencies in racial and ethnic discrimination in employment emphasize the irrational character of the discriminations and their negative influence on modern society.
