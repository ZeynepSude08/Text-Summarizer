should european cities ban or restrict the operation of escooters?
escooter, also known as a motorized scooter, has emerged as new means of transportation in many cities worldwide, especially in european countries.
therefore, from failing to meet some of the federal traffic requirements, european cities have threatened to ban escooters service, which has aroused the debate on whether to ban or restrict the escoopers operations.
firstly, many people have embraced escooters as means of transport because they require low maintenance costs and are easily accessible.
a conducive environment is crucial to anyone, and thus the restriction to allow the operation of the escooters is better than banning them.
