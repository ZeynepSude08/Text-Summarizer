a possible solution to remedying the effects of such dangerous advertising includes policy changes that consist of regulating content and volume of marketing, the relationship between alcohol and activities targeted at younger people, and moderating emerging advertising techniques such as those seen on social media.
while alcohol consumption is not the direct source of these issues, the current marketing, pricing, and management of alcohol production and distribution does not address the hazards of intoxication and needs better regulation.
