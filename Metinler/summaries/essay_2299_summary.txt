the study i analyzed presented an investigation of sleeps ability to consolidate memory for longterm storage.
the studys primary goal presented in the article was to investigate the consolidation of hippocampusdependent memories during sleep through stimulation by smell.
the researchers concluded that once an odor became associated with the context of memorized object locations, repeated exposure to an odor during sleep reactivated new memories and thereby accelerated their consolidation.
this could significantly change the idea of memory consolidation during sleep and expand the boundaries for research.
