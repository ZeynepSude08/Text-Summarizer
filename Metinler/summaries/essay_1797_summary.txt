the influence of water quality on the population of salmonid fish proposal
it is expected that populations of wild salmonid fish may decline rapidly due to water pollution instead of farmed species because the effects of water pollution are deleterious.
it is proposed that the experimental sample of salmonids be placed in an artificial tank with water mixed with sewage waste, while the control group is placed in a tank of the same size and under the same physical conditions, with the difference being that the water filling it must be favorable to the fish, that is, from their usual habitat.
this study aimed to investigate the effects of polluted waters on the quality of life of salmonid fish.
the experimental fish population was expected to decline due to the deleterious effects of polluted waters.
