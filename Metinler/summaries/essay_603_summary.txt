however, the budgeted net profit is 153.9 higher due to the lower sales volume in the actual performance.

consequently, the company is required to minimize the selling costs and increase its sales volume to continue earning higher returns.

in the data above, direct labor costs take a more considerable percentage of all the costs involved in the performance of this company.
as production increases, labor cost also increases that is why in the budgeted performance, the cost of direct labor is 2 higher than the actual cost of direct labor.
this is evident in the two charts as it indicates that the direct materials costs are higher in the budgeted performance with higher sales.
the budgeted plan with higher sales has a lower percentage of the variable cost than the actual plan with lower sales.
it is closely followed by the fixed cost, which includes those costs that do not change when production or sales volume changes they do not vary with the output volume.
this is evident in the charts above, as they shows that in the budgeted program, the fixed cost is 6.76, and the actual program is 7.87.
from the aboveanalyzed data, we can say that both the businesss actual and planned performance is in the same line, and there is a slight diversion on the actual and intended outcome hence, they are positively related in terms of profit goals of the company.
