the craft of art direction has enabled the audience of the sherlock to clearly locate the venues of every scene.
through the art direction, we are able to learn that the deaths of mp beth davenport, sir jeffrey patterson and james phillimore all happened at different locations where the victims of the murder cases had no any reason for them to be at these locations but the causes of the death are similar.
for example, when sherlock and john enter the taxi at the street of baker leaving for the scene of the first murder case, a filming crane is reflected behind the taxi.
in the sherlock film, sherlock gets into the cab but john, still looking through the window, calls the cell phone of the victim.
