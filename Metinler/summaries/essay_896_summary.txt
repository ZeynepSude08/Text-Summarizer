as a business consultant for sun city boards, i would suggest that the company adopt the swot analysis as a strategic management tool.
sun city boards can use the swot analysis to leverage on its own strengths, address its weaknesses, limit its threats, and take advantage of its opportunities.
swot analysis will help sun city boards to realize the importance of setting goals that are derived from its mission and vision statements.
