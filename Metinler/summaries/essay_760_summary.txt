the film showcases a phenomenal cultural difference between the chinese and american communities, growing pains, internal and external conflicts, and the changing attitudes about work in light of everincreasing globalization.
in the film american factory, bognar and reichert delve deep into the livelihoods of the american workers in ohio and the problematic transition experienced by chinese managers to american work culture and way of life.
fuyao management establishes talks on several occasions to educate them about the american work culture and the importance of union organizations to workers.
it is a correct argument to suggest that g.m. has employed more foreign workers than americans in the u.s. on the issue of culture and productivity, this documentary, american factory, showcased sufficient evidence of the role that autonomy and trust perform in industrial manufacturing in chinese markets.
due to its onesided narration of the factory, highlighting cultural variations while ignoring the advantages to nearby workers, the movie, in a single experience, will no doubt make contributions to an understanding that chinese funding in u.s. production is something to be avoided and in that respect, the film has a decidedly antichina thrust.
