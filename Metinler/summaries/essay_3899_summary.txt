by applying for the dietetic internship at florida international university, i am looking forward to integrating my knowledge of balanced nutrition into counseling people to gain healthier eating habits.
currently, my primary goal is to help people get better in their nutritional patterns and come into harmony with themselves, letting them know that food is not bad to eat, but that it fuels a healthier life.
organizing and playing a leading role in many extracurricular events and meetings dedicated to poor eating habits and lack of nutritional knowledge in society, in both academic and clinical settings, have allowed me to achieve good results by expanding my knowledge and doing extra research.
i have strengths in leadership, individual work, and technical knowledge, but i understand that i need further improvement in my practical experience, teamwork, and contentious learning of dietetics.
