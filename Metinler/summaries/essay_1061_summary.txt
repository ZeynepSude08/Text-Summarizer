using automated iv pumps has improved the efficiency of service care, reduced errors and flexibility, which is believed to improve general patient safety.
patient safety and care are the major concerns to all hence the study will evaluate the patient outcomes related to use of automated iv pumps to come up with the necessary measures.
however much the technological measures have improved the level of patient care, there are still issues about patient safety concerning the use of technological evolutions, such as they have automated iv pumps.
my study will aim at finding out both positive and negative impacts of automated iv pumps on patient care and safety to give the necessary support to use automated iv pumps in the nursing profession or not.
above all, automated iv pumps simplify the treatment process as nurses find enough time to attend to patient hence improving patient safety and treatment for quality recovery.
in addition, programmed language of automated iv pumps may have an error which might lead to serious health effects to patients leading to low patient care and safety.
having reduced medication errors and flexibility of automated iv pumps, nurses have lately achieved a lot in care and patient safety.
