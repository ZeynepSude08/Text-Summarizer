offshore wind farms owfs and their development research paper
2. offshore wind farm design
this research paper will analyze the development of offshore wind farms owfs and their contribution to the sustainable environment.
owfs plants are well equipped with facilities capable of capturing wind power, transforming it into electrical energy, and then supplying it to the main station for distribution.
offshore wind farm design
owfs have several advantages like extensive free space for constructing large structures, availability of stronger winds yielding more power, consistent wind flow, ability to minimize noise pollution, providing renewable energy, and not release harmful carbon gases leading to environmental sustainability chipindula et al., 2018.
