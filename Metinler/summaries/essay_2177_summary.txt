above all, i do not agree with cutting funding for programs that support people who have disabilities because it is socially unjust.
cutting funding for programs for people who have disabilities would make it harder for their families to make ends meet and focus on other aspects of life, promoting social injustice.
to summarize, cutting funding for programs for people who have disabilities is socially unjust as it would show the public that the authorities do not value them and take away their means for everyday life.
