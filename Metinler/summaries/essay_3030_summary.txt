racism is the conviction that some groups of people with different inherited attributes such as the color of skin or shape of eyes possess certain behavioral traits that make them inferior to the representatives of other races.
antiracism is about being free from prejudice towards people of other races and being active in fighting racism.
at the same time, it could be noted that in spite of all the actions taken, the issue of racism remains immensely topical, and people of color keep on suffering from prejudice and even hatred.
the creation of an utterly antiracist society requires the hard work of every individual because there are no policies and regulations that could alter the thoughts and attitudes of people.
