i want to share my recent experience of narcotic anonymous and alcoholics anonymous mutual aid groups attendance, which helped me see the world differently.
listening to the group members personal experiences, who shared intimate, usually sad facts of their biography, was sad.
a sense of the common problem and the belief in collective help were the factors that brought the group together, liberating its members and creating a supportive environment comparable to a psychotherapeutic session.
nevertheless, the existence of such groups as narcotic anonymous and alcoholics anonymous show the importance of truthful sharing of our feelings with those who genuinely care.
