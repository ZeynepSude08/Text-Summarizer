my generation significantly influenced my views on medicinerelated issues and problems, for example, it shaped my belief that the singlepayer healthcare system is a better option compared to the current one in the u.s. the attitude towards abortions is also an important theme for millennials who, including me, mostly support the prochoice stance and the womens opportunity to make their own decisions concerning their bodies.
