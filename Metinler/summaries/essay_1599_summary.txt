they lack the typical threedimensional longrange organization of crystal structures, thus, amorphous solids have a much more randomized arrangement of molecules.
amorphous solids are similar to liquids throughout as they lack an ordered structure or threedimensional arrangements of atoms or electrons.
the purpose of this report is to describe the history, structure, properties, and applications in real life of amorphous solids.
some examples of amorphous solids are clay, plastic, and glass.
structure of amorphous solids
since they lack crystalline structure as shown in figure 1 and have flow properties, amorphous solids are sometimes referred to as pseudosolids as well as supercooled liquids.

properties of amorphous solids
amorphous solids display the following qualities, they possess a shortrange order, have no sharp melting point, are pseudo solids in nature, are isotropic, have indefinite heat of fusion, and show rough and irregular surfaces when cut into two.
plastics and other amorphous solids, for example, plastics offer very high resistance to the flow of electricity and are thus called good electrical insulators.
amorphous solids are isotropic
if quartz, the crystalline material of sio2, is heated to melt and then quickly cooled, it forms an amorphous solid called silica glass.
glasses, candy resins, and plastics are just a few examples of amorphous solids.
examples of amorphous solids
thus, amorphous solids are found in all solid material subsets.
the most common reallife applications of amorphous solids include transparent glasses, the manufacturing of polymeric structural materials, amorphous semiconductors used in electronics, and magnetic amorphous solids used in making storage devices.
magnetic amorphous solids
amorphous solids have an atomic structure that is disorganized and are characterized by qualities such as shortrange order, lack of sharp melting point, isotropic, indefinite heat of fusion, and show rough and irregular surfaces when cut into two.
