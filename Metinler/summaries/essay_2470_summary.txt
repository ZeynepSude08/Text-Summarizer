in order to achieve that, the scholars examined how the clownfish larvaes preference towards various olfactory clues changed in the seawater of different acidity levels.
the results indicate a significant difference in the ability of larval clownfish to discriminate between different olfactory clues depending on the water acidity.
the last group of larvae that were reared in the ph 7.6 exhibited the most outstanding results as it was found that clownfish just become passive and do not react to any olfactory clues.
