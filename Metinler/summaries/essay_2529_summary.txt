precisely this division of opinions resulted in the fact that, during the reconstruction era, presidents abraham lincoln and andrew johnson decided to follow moderate and merciful policy, while the radical republicans insisted on harsher measures.
officially, presidential reconstruction was inaugurated in 1865, after andrew johnson became the president of the united states.
this plan was stated in his proclamation of amnesty and reconstruction, which was issued in 1863 and addressed several terms that he expected most southerners to accept.
to begin with, johnsons proclamation of amnesty and pardon for the confederate states provided southerners with an easy opportunity to return their property and status if they supported the u.s. constitution.
as mentioned above, though congress and both presidents had the same general object to unite the country after the civil war, radical reconstruction was opposed to the presidential one and had a different approach to the situation.
in their wadedavis bill, congress insisted on the necessity of the majority of confederate states officials and voters to swear that they were never supporters of the confederation or opposed to the u.s. unless one took this oath, they could not take part in the souths following political affairs.
after johnson became the president, congress was not pleased with his intention to continue lincolns plan aimed at quick reincorporation of the southern states.
