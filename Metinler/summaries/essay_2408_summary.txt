this paper provides insights on maslows hierarchy of needs, its relation to the hospitality industry, especially the bartender job, and the effects if not implemented.
in the bartenders job, the need for selfactualization enables them to understand the customers desire by assessing its importance and how it affects them.
understanding needs through love shows a significant correlation between maslows hierarchy of needs and the bartender job in the hospitality industry.
a bar does that by uniting people with various needs, including shelter, food, and group love, by putting the bartender as the link to the diverse needs required by the guest.
esteem and prestige stated in maslows hierarchy of needs correlate with the bartender job.
despite satisfying the hierarchical needs of guests in the bar, the bartenders also have some desires while working.
as indicated in the hierarchy of needs, a safe environment under safety needs is an essential factor provided to the bartender.
the bartenders are also people hence, they develop psychological needs such as food, shelter, and comfort, especially at work.
selfactualization is also an essential need that enables bartenders to develop their inborn talent, potential, resources, and accomplishments.
the need for selfesteem and prestige is also essential for bartenders as it enables reputation, recognition, and respect between the bartenders and the managers, allowing them to navigate the bars harsh environment.
the abandoning of maslows hierarchy of needs will undermine love and belonging, enabling the employees to engage in teamwork therefore, there will be slow services provision without collaboration, especially in the bar hence, the bar might lose its customers.
