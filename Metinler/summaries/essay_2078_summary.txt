understanding what modern technological solutions can alleviate the inconvenience of monitoring blood pressure is essential in ascertaining their applicability to caring for patients with hypertension.
second, all studies agree that the traditional method of measuring blood pressure is inconvenient, timeconsuming, and may even exacerbate the patients condition.
caring for patients with hypertension requires constant monitoring of blood pressure.
3. an automated blood pressure device is installed on a patients wrist.
an automated blood pressure device is a technological element, which can significantly improve care to a patient with hypertension.
the patient has to constantly measure his blood pressure in order to prevent the uncontrolled conditions, which are caused by constant hypertension.
neither the patients, not their caretakers have to constantly measure blood pressure, as the device is automatic.
when applied to this cases patient, automated blood pressure device used together with the bpt has the capacity to solve all his problems.
even if the patient forgets about measuring his blood pressure, it will still be analyzed and sent to the electronic health records.
the device minimizes the patients role and possible harm he can inflict to himself by refusing or forgetting to measure blood pressure.
the proposed solution is asking the patient to consent to the use of bpt with the connected automated blood pressure device.
as the doctor receives input from the automated blood pressure device, they will offer recommendations to the patient regarding their routine, daily activities, nutrition, and other factors influencing blood pressure.
the solution is to use blood pressure telemonitoring, which retrieves the data from an automated blood pressure device on the patients wrist directly into the doctors office.
automated compared to manual office blood pressure and to home blood pressure in hypertensive patients.
