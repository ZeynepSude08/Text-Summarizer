it is possible to anticipate the properties of materials under various loading conditions by looking at the stressstrain relationships of different metals van zijl, slowik, toledo filho, wittmann,  mihashi, 2016.
mild steel outperformed aluminum in this testing in terms of tensile and yield strength.
as a result, the tensile strength of the materials used in structural applications should be adequate.
tensile tests, which apply axial or longitudinal force to a specimen with given dimensions, may be used to estimate a materials tensile characteristics.
using the tensile load and the related extensions, the stressstrain equation of the material specimen is calculated and determined.
in addition, to yield strength, percentage of elongation, and ultimate strength, the tensile test experiment may be used to assess additional mechanical properties of the specimen.
mild steel is often used in many technical applications that call for high tensile strength.
