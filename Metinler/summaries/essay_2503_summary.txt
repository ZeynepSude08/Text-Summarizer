personal values and sexuality in christianity coursework
1. christianity and sexuality
christianity and sexuality
as a believer, it also helps me believe in some good cultural values like sex before marriage which is a sin before god and my own body.
as a believer, some values do not go along with christianity which means i do not have trust in them lgbt is one of them.
however, some members of my family believe in it, which is against christianity and moral values.
therefore, as a christian, i do not believe a man can marry another man or a woman marries another woman.
instead, i can tell them the values they should possess as far as sexuality is involved according to what the bible teaches.
