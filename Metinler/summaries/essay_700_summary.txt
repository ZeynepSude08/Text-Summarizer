seabird extinction from invasive rodent species research paper
5. ways of protecting seabirds from invasive rodent species
unfortunately, at present, many seabird species are at risk of extinction because of multiple anthropogenic threats, including bycatch, invasive species, land use, climate change, and energy production richards et al., 2021.
among them, invasive rodent species are the most destructive to the environment and especially affect seabirds scanes, 2018.
this paper will review seabirds role in ecosystems, the invasive rodent species and their impact on seabirds, and methods of protecting seabirds from nonnative rodents.
according to scanes 2018, there are four invasive rodent species threatening the survival of seabirds.
invasive rodent species significantly influence the life of seabirds.
a study analyzing which seabirds traits increase their risk of being affected by rodents found that species with a pelagic specialism and slow reproductive speed were the most vulnerable to rodent threats richards et al., 2021.
moreover, macgillivrays prion, a smallsized seabird species nearly endemic to gough island, can become extinct by 2057 with a 31 probability because of mouse predation jones et al., 2021.
rodent species also pose a significant threat to the survival of endemic seabird species  vireo gracilirostris and elaenia ridleyana  on fernando de noronha micheletti et al., 2020.
this evidence suggests that, without effective interventions, seabirds are at an increased risk of extinction due to invasive rodent species predation.
ways of protecting seabirds from invasive rodent species
on saintpaul island, situated in the south of the indian ocean, rat eradication resulted in increased seabird population growth rates 20 years later, especially in species most vulnerable to rodent depredation barbraud et al., 2021.
to sum up, by traveling by ships, humans introduced invasive rodent species to islands serving as the habitat for many seabird species.
