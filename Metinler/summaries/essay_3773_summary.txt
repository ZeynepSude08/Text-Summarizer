main issues covered in terms of youth sports participation in the united states
according to atencio and wright 2008, the main issue covered in youth sports participation in the united states revolves around the relationship between the african american culture and basketball.
from another perspective, messner 2002 brings out another severe issue associated with youths involved in sports in the united states.
they should not be surprised if this is the case because, according to such experiences, its clear to establish the connection between athletic youths and violent acts in the u.s. critical race, ethnicity, and indigenous culture issues on youth and pro sports
with this said, conflicts still exist in sports organizations, youth and professional alike, and that is why apart from states like oregon, maine, and wisconsin, native american mascots are still in use in sports throughout the country, which is offensive to native americans gary, n.d. in the words of susan harjo, gary shows that being called a redskin portrays the worst kind of humiliation of associating with any native american.
borrowing from atencio and wright 2008, the argument raised is that even with the critical explanations made to show the connection between young adults and professional sportspeople, what culturally underpins basketball in african american neighborhoods outlines the broader notion that is black athletic masculinity.
however, modernday works correlate to the historical foundations in sports that still teach male athletes to practice hegemonic masculinity and black masculinity among african americans.
