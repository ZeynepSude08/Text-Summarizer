one of the most valuable technologies that significantly benefit people is magnetic resonance imaging mri.
kose 2021 states that mri was first proposed in 1973 by lauterbur, who presented a crosssectional image of water protons in two test tubes by nuclear magnetic resonance.
exceptionally clear mri images obtained as a result of the study allow doctors to see even minimal tumors and small inflammatory processes in all tissues containing water.
mri makes it possible to more deeply examine the data on diseases and get a comprehensive study based on the images isin et al., 2016.
the accumulated clinical data obtained over half a century of using mri allows people to interpret the image characteristics with high accuracy and identify pathologies that cannot be determined using other diagnostic methods.
if earlier magnetic resonance imaging was strictly prohibited for patients with vascular stents, now, in most cases, such patients are not prohibited from conducting this type of study.
magnetic resonance imaging was also contraindicated for patients with nonremovable dentures.
in addition, the principle of ct is based on xrays, which harm the body, and mri creates a layered image of organs and tissues.
magnetic resonance imaging is a safe, noninvasive method of imaging soft tissue structures.
the duration of obtaining a standard mri image today is also a great inconvenience for patients.
in conclusion, the magnetic resonance imaging device is significant and necessary for monitoring the populations health.
