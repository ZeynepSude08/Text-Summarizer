this paper will form a framework to compare automatic dependent surveillancebroadcast adsb, global positioning system gps, and how the faas nextgen systemwide information shapes aircraft systems future.
this is a more accurate system than the current radar that broadcast aircraft information like speed, location, and route to air controllers using satellite radio signals and ground stations.
it incorporates both advancements in adsb and gps for a more secure, efficient, and resilient aircraft system that is more accurate with realtime data sharing.
there is efficient communication of accurate data between different aircraft operators, highsecurity surveillance, and improved onboard technology.
