the experiment will monitor the reduction of crvi by glutathione, record the results, and investigate the reactions doubleexponential dependency.
the reactions rate equation and rate constants will be determined using exponential stripping and computerassisted nonlinear regression analysis.
on the other hand, during the second trial the obtained results were k 1  0.00275 ????
the experiment investigated the time dependency of glutathione reduction of crvi in an aqueous solution.
experiment 6 kinetics of a reversible, firstorder, consecutive reaction reduction of crvi by glutathione
