the first thing we did was we have tried to educate the armenian public and raise awareness among people about the humanitarian crisis in nagornokarabakh due to attacks by turkey and azerbaijan.
the fund organizes various awarenessraising campaigns around the world and realizes many projects, events, and awards to help the armenian community.
i have challenged myself to dedicate all the time, effort, and money that i could to improve the status of the armenian community and to encourage other nonindifferent people to make a contribution.
