this paper will examine the differences in such concepts as samsara, nirvana, karma, and rebirth as perceived by buddhists and hinduists.
samsara, karma, rebirth, and nirvana exist in both philosophies and are some of the main concepts in hinduism and buddhism.
while in the case of hinduism, samsara is the cyclical rebirth of the soul that remains unchanged, buddhism teaches that samsara is the transformation of a person into something else.
on the other hand, hinduism teaches that in order for one to achieve a state of nirvana moksha, one must accept the soul for the endless rebirth cycle to end and piece to be achieved as an ultimate goal within the entire philosophy.
this contrasts with buddhist beliefs that only the individual can influence karma with personal decisions, actions, and intentions.
as mentioned prior, buddhists do not believe in the existence of an eternal soul, which is not the case in hinduism teachings astore, 2021.
while hinduism teaches that the soul migrates once a person dies and appears in another body without suffering alteration, this is not the case in buddhism.
thus, rebirth is a more highlighted concept for buddhists because the soul does not have a cyclical nature and death of the body does not correlate with the remaining of the self.
the four seemingly identical notions that are at the core of both philosophies are samsara, nirvana, karma, and rebirth.
hinduism highlights that the soul migrates once a person dies, which buddhism refers to as the ephemeral nature of self that does not persist throughout time and space.
while buddhists believe that ones karma is solely dependent on the persons actions and intentions, hinduism includes the influence of god alongside the individuals personal decisions.
