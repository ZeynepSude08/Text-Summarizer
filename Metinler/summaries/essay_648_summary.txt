although lemuel haynes and mary wollstonecraft discussed two distinct issues, slavery and female rights, the fundamental idea behind their works was that liberty and freedom should be equally distributed to all in a civilized society.
this rhetoric analysis argues that both authors created the framework for defining the good life by claiming that rights and liberties are inherent to all people and thus they should not be withdrawn from someone.
in summary, haynes and wollstonecraft used the framework of slavery and womens rights, respectively, to raise the issue of liberty.
evaluating their works and the tone they used in their writings allowed me to understand that equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities are essential for society to reach a virtuous life.
