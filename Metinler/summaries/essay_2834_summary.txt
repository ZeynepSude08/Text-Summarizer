the study by steven brunton and others at the university of washington demonstrates the use of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics sindy.
for instance, the discovery of kepler, although equipped with extensive and most accurate planetary data, lacked fundamental dynamic relationship description of planetary orbits brunton et al., 2016.
, x t  is the systems state at duration t and f x t is the dynamic constraint brunton et al.,2016.
when  is large the z dynamics are fast and the slowing manifold z x 2  y 2 .
the work applied sparse regression in determining dynamic equations that accurately represent data.
