the u.s. national debt clock displays the federal governments outstanding debt.
the public debt is represented by twothirds of the clock in treasury bills, notes, and bonds, including people, corporations, and foreign governments.
thus, the government owes a third of the debt, including federal programs such as social security voitolovskii 393.
the public debt is the amount the government owes to treasury investors voitolovskii 394.
combining this issue with the reality that many people are unaware of how the national debt level impacts their everyday lives might result in a topic for debate.
the chance of the government defaulting on its debt service obligations rises as the national debt per capita increases hence, the treasury department will have to raise the return on freshly issued treasury securities to entice new investors.
