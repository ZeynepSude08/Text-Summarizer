from school, i actively attend and watch artistic dances and cultural celebrations.
before the pandemic, i had experience in attending mexican festivals and dances, chinese new year celebrations, and performances by ukrainian dancers.
i really liked the festival, its theme, cultural background, and amusing dance component.
next year, i will definitely try to see the celebration live to become more familiar with mexican culture, dancing, and ceremonies.
