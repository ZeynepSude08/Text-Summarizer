miranda warning, also known as miranda rights, is a formal statement in which a person being arrested is informed of their basic civil rights under the jurisdiction of the united states.
therefore, even if they are not presented at the moment of an arrest, miranda rights will be given later once the situation is secured and prior to launching formal legal procedures.
