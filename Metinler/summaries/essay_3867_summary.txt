the clear water was collected as a filtrate in a beaker under the filter paper, while the wet chalk powder, which had acquired an intense gray hue, was in the filter.
in the second part of the work, a mixture of 10 g of solid calcium hydroxide and 50 ml of drinking water in a beaker was initially created.
the mixture was passed through filter paper, resulting in purified water collected in a flask under the filter.
some of the chalk powder remained at the bottom of the plate after water evaporation indicates that not all of the chalk was left in the filter.
