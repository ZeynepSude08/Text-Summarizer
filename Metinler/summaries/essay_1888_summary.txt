towering spaciousness is an abstract piece of contemporary art by hans hofmann completed in 1956, when the artist was already 76 years old.
landau uses the word rhythmic due to the appeared loudness of the painting that comes from hofmanns color choices.
hofmann strived to encourage artists to connect with nature, and one of the tools he believed in was color.
while the painting does not have representational forms or perspective, it appears to be threedimensional regardless, due to the artists use of color and shape.
