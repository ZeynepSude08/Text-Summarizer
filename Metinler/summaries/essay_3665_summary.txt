the implementation of technology in health and elder care has its benefits and challenges.
in the situations when elderly people move to nursing houses, the number of communication opportunities increases therefore, robots as caretakers do not seem to produce a negative effect.
in my opinion, wired houses are a good modification of peoples lives, but firstly elderly people cannot usually afford them.
with the development of technology, more and more devices are being implemented in elder or health care.
