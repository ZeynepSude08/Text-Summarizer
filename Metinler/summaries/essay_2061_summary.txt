this paragraph taught me some important lessons about the specific types and modes of spread of biological weapons, namely botulism, anthrax, and agroterrorism.
botulism is one of the most dangerous biological weapons because of its high mortality rate, ease of spread, and because a negligible amount of toxin 1 gram can kill more than a million people dembek  anderson, 2007.
the bacteria bacillus anthracis, which causes anthrax, is one of the most dangerous and wellknown biological weapons.
agroterrorism is the use of chemical or biological weapons against agricultural or food industries.
