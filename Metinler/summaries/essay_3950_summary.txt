the american west has always been and continues to be home to numerous groups of heterogeneous aboriginal people who have formed their different ideas about place, space, and landscape formation.
examples of such actions will be discussed in this paper and a statement related to the formation of landscape morphology, both natural and cultural will be investigated.
the native american approach to space and habitat is characterized by a more conscious understanding of mans relationship to nature and the natural elements that also shape the landscape.
