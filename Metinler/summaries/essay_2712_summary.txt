does drinking caffeine affect students performance on tests?
thus, the critical interest in this experiment is to determine the relationship between coffee consumption before exams and students own performance on those exams.
first, the university exam is not a real exam because if the hypotheses turn out to work, the researcher assumes responsibility for the low results in the students.
on the day of the test, students write an exam in one discipline e.g., math and formally stop participating in the experiment when they finish writing the test.
thus, with this test, it will be possible to statistically reliably indicate whether there is an effect of coffee consumption on exam results.
