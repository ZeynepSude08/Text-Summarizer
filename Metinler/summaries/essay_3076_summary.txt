apart from blaming my colleague for what happened, i somehow felt that the patient challenged my communication skills apart from him being psychotic, though i could have approached him differently.
sharing feelings can be done by encouraging communication with others, making observations, giving permission for expression, acknowledging other peoples feelings, and modeling well emotional assertiveness.
when sharing feelings, it is significant to be concerned with personal emotions, as solid feelings may be challenging to hide most of the time.
from the reaction, i got from the patient and the consequence i faced after it, i did not share my feelings with other colleagues since i was upset, which contributed most to the conflict with my workmate.
upon being embarrassed by a workmate or somebody else, i learned that i should not show emotions when performing my duties but instead share my feelings with other colleagues.
practicing good communication skills which involves hiding my emotions during work will help me do a quality job and provide services to people as required.
