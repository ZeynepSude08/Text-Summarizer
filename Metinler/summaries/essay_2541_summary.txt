the discussed concepts and their indepth interpretations made by the authors significantly contribute to my knowledge in the field of qualitative research, based on my prior learning experience, the concepts of bias and subjectivity were often confused for one another and even referred to interchangeably.
however, upon studying the discussions presented in the readings, i have expanded my perspective on subjectivity in qualitative research and acquired a reflective journal method to facilitate the credibility of my research projects in the future.
overall, when synthesizing the concepts of bias, subjectivity, and reflexivity, one might conclude that these issues inevitably occur in qualitative research but might be effectively managed to ensure credibility.
