it will also focus on the directions given to zoe, who is in charge of the organizations accounting books, to adjust some entries in the book.
in our case study, the president requests zoe baas, the controller of the company accounting books, to accrue every possible revenue.
these actions are done to adjust the organizations accounting figures, which inflates its revenue by illegally accruing some of its revenues and deflating its expenses by wrongly delaying some costs.
in this case study, zoe can still be legal if the deferring of the companys costs and accruing of the companys revenues are done as provided in the accounting policies and following the gaap and ifrs framework.
in our case study, the adjustments the manager instructed zoe to make in the accounting books do not follow these regulations hence they will be unlawful.
