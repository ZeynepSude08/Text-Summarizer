accordingly, gods spirit lives in every christian as in a temple hence, one may conclude that the body of every believer is gods temple.
with knowledge, convictions, and thoughts, the believer is filled with understanding of life and happiness, just as the temple of god is filled with the holy spirit.
the main idea is that the bodies of christians are a holy place where gods spirit not only lives but is supported, flourishes, and worshiped.
