calishers the scream on fiftyseventh street is a short story about a widow in her early 40s who learns to live without her husband of 20 years who dies.
this short story reveals such themes as madness, manlessness, and isolation and makes the readers think about the feminine roles of those times.
manlessness is another subject that made me think of the role of women in the period when the short story was written.
i think that the protagonist of this short story became mad because of loneliness and the inability to live an independent life.
