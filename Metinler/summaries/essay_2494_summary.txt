despite difficulties related to determining falls actual preventability, the nopay policy was meant to motivate hospitals to reduce financial losses by increasing the use of fall reduction interventions, including room changes, physical barriers, and bed alarms fehlberg et al., 2018.
specifically, effectiveness and quality improvement potential vary between diverse pf prevention practices, being more explicit for riskfactorspecific patient education provided by rns and less pronounced for bed alarm use fehlberg et al., 2018 staggs et al., 2020.
pf, as a mandatory quality indicator, motivates the timely provision of individualized injury prevention advice tailored to patients needs, thus supporting healthcare consumers autonomy and the right to participate in intervention selection barmentloo et al., 2021.
the selected quality measure has influenced patient care and nursing practice by motivating experiments with fall prevention measures and protocols.
after the recognition of pf as an ndnqi indicator, nursing practice has changed to include more frequent interventions involving bed alarm use, but the practice of using patient sitters has not become more common fehlberg et al., 2018.
finally, being underpinned by the cms nopay policy, the pf indicator partially supports better quality outcomes and medical ethics and influences patient care and nurses practice by increasing the utilization of fall prevention strategies.
