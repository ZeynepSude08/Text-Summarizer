the hyperloop is a transportation system high speed that accelerates highspeed pods through a lowpressure tube.

the concept and design of the hyperloop
they were working to create a reasonable hyperloop cost assessment and engineering proposal.
space x company, owned by elon musk, announced an open competition for independent engineering teams and university students to develop the best design and build the most effective and efficient hyperloop pod.
they created an innovative pod that employed the design of utilizing magnetic levitation other than using air cushioning to reduce the friction of the pods.
linear induction series of motors would be employed in the hyperloop pod to achieve the proposed los angelessan francisco 35 minutes trip to accelerate the pod to nearly the speed of sound approximately 760 mileshour.
propelling the pods through a vacuum hyperloop tube
the other scientific challenge facing the hyperloop is reducing the large friction caused by air when the hyperloop is moving through the tube.
designing the pods with aerodynamics is vital even when the hyperloop tubes operate at very low pressure.
in addition, the material costs should be kept down, which implies that the area of the crosssection of both the hyperloop pod and hyperloop tube should be very close to each other.
in addition, according to elon musk, the design hyperloop will be designed such that the passengers experience a 0.5g inertial acceleration maximum.
notably, the pods design which will be used in the hyperloop, is not yet finished.
