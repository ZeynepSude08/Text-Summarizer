mathematical platonism is the concept that describes the existence, abstractness, and independence as adjectives for mathematics routine practices.
this paper will discuss realism and true realism as concepts that help understand mathematical platonism and answer the question of existence, abstractedness, and independence.
platonism is a mathematics philosophy insinuating that some objects exist independent of external variables, such as people, thoughts, and routine practices.
consequently, the mathematical theory of platonism has developed objections based on freges argument ruloff, 2020.
mathematical platonism is that mathematical adjectives replace the idea that arises from existence, abstractness, and independence.
thus, mathematical platonism indicates that objects exist abstractly, independent of intelligent agents such as language and believes.
however, object realism leaves out independence because it is logically weak in the concept of mathematical platonism.
the argument of object realism is stronger than mathematical platonism because many scientists believe in nonphysical objects as long as they are dependent on material things paul, 2020.
mathematical platonism promotes the concept of natural value realism by enhancing the platform where the mathematical objects acquire their truth value paul, 2020.
mathematical platonism involves the ideas of existence, abstractness, and independence as adjectives for mathematics routine practices.
