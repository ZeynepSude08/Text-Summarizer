this essay will explore what constitutes proper behavior for brahmins in the novel for their hindu religion and caste system.

praneshacharya was using his caring for his wife as a gate to enter heaven ananthamurthy, 2012.
naropa lost his position as a brahmin due to his acts of bringing home chandri, a lower caste woman.
