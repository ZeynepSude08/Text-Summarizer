based on such variables as weight loss and the average amount of physical activity calculated in minutes, it was established that online dpp secures the same efficiency rates as the other interventions, making it a relevant and beneficial alternative for people unable to reach out to the professionals personally moin et al., 2018.
hence, the findings of this study demonstrate that the implementation of online dpp can become an asset in terms of diabetes prevention among the ones who have a predisposition to the development of this condition at some point in life.
besides reducing primary risks, online dpp is a beneficial tool to manage people with prediabetes or already existing diabetes.
in essence, online dpp is an additional beneficial tool for both primary and secondary prevention of diabetes.
