spinal nerves
dorsal rami of spinal nerves serve the muscles and skin of the human back.
the ventral rami of most spinal nerves form networks called plexuses.
in the ganglion, axons either synapse with the second neuron or go further to form the splanchnic nerves.
in the parasympathetic division, preganglionic neurons are located in cranial nerves iii, vii, ix, and x and spinal nerves s2s4.
preganglionic axons pass through cranial nerves and enter a terminal ganglion, where they synapse with the motor neuron.
in the sacral region, axons leaving the spinal cord form pelvic nerves that extend to the pelvic cavity and synapse with motor neurons in the terminal ganglia.
