though the early suffrage movement lacked diversity and the associated perspectives, it did lay the foundation for the 19trh amendment despite quite vocal claims against change among some of the more racist tennessee women, who saw the regulation as the gateway to expanding the rights of african americans.
according to hewitt and lawson 2019, tennessee women assumed that the 19 th amendment would become the gateway to african americans, in general, receiving the right to vote, which tennessee protesters considered inadmissible.
while not being as inclusive due to the neglect of the specific needs of african american women and the lack of representation thereof in it, the u.s. suffragette movement of the 1920s created a platform for the further emancipation of american women.
