this papers objective is to discuss the pathophysiology of intraoperative hypotension, or low blood pressure, with a focus on the causes of hypotension occurring at the cellularreceptor level.
intraoperative hypotension ioh is a major factor associated with postoperative complications and high rates of mortality following noncardiac surgery.
even though there is no single definition of what can be considered intraoperative hypotension, physicians commonly use the indication of mean arterial pressure less than 65 mmhg.
the current research has identified several major causes of intraoperative hypotension.
although several conditions and processes have been identified as causes of intraoperative hypotension, more research needs to be done on the treatments and perioperative management of ioh.
most frequently, ioh or intraoperative hypotension is determined as a mean arterial pressure map lower than the 25 average value of the patient.
to be able to treat intraoperative hypotension and avoid its dangerous postoperative outcomes, health professionals have to identify its causes.
patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia can have hypotension caused by various pathophysiologic mechanisms, which means that the etiology of ioh involves a range of factors.
intraoperative hypotension and the risk of postoperative adverse outcomes a systematic review.
