first of all, my husband is exceptionally proud of his african roots, so it is a pleasure for him to wear dreadlocks.
with the earliest african people wearing dreadlocks approximately as far back as 550 b.c., it may be noted that the spiritual significance of this hairstyle is similar to a religious belief agwuele, 2016.
i believe my husband wears dreadlocks to remain in line with his ethnic roots and maintain a spiritual connection to his ancestors.
i believe that my husband knowingly wears his dreadlocks to pay homage to the nonconformity that was promoted by rastafarians and his african ancestors.
even though my husband is not exactly a highly spiritual person, i believe that his dreadlocks tell a lot about him.
