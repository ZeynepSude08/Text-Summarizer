act utilitarianism is a theory in ethics defined by a persons deed being right morally if the act only gives the best and expected results in a certain situation.
however, to achieve outstanding results in character, it is possible to combine the two theories by first implementing the approach of virtue and later analyzing the outcome based on utilitarianism.
whereas virtue ethics is concerned with the character of the individual doing an act, utilitarianism is a moral argument that assumes that an activity is ethical if it is beneficial to the majority.
