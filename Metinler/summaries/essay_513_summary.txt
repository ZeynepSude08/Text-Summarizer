mathematical analysis of the pyramid of the louvre research paper
a mathematical analysis of the louvre is helpful to begin with elements of descriptive geometry, which will give a more accurate idea of the pyramids forms.
according to pei, the maximum height of the pyramid at its peak is 20.6 meters, with each of the sides of the louvres square base equal to 35 meters figure 2.
in other words, people usually occupy a volume not exceeding 6,360.96 cubic meters from the louvre pyramid.
the pyramid in the louvre museum in the center of paris illustrated the power of the synthesis of analytic geometry, trigonometry, and functional analysis to investigate different aspects of the pyramid.
in particular, all sides and angles within the pyramid were calculated, and areas and volumes were measured.
a calculation was made of the usable area occupied by people and suggested a way to expand the number of tourists who could visit the louvre pyramid at the same time.
thus, the general conclusion of the whole work is that a large number of mathematical tools are applicable to the louvre pyramid, which has been demonstrated.
