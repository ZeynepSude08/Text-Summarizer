it is demonstrated that there is a close connection between modern work requirements and conditions, the stress experienced in family life and immediate harm to the psychological health of a person.
primarily, this essay focuses on the factors that cause stress and at the same time represent a kind of combination between a persons work and family activities.
in the context of constant pressure at work, the need to spend more time with children can be expressed in increased tension between family members, conflict, and mutual misunderstanding.
speaking about other family problems that a modern person is forced to pay attention to, it is necessary to stipulate the need to take care of elderly relatives.
considering that in modern economic and cultural conditions a woman must also work and be the second earner in the family, the conditions of such a life turn out to be extremely stressful.
speaking about the context as close as possible to modernity, one would also need to highlight the problem of stressful stress on a persons family and work life in the context of a pandemic situation.
thus, it can be concluded that modern working conditions, requiring constant availability and willingness to perform work, are superimposed on similar social requirements to constantly take care of the family and children.
