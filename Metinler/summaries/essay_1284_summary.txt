the virtual exhibition that i chose to visit is the one at the smithsonian national museum of american history, exploring the american food culture from the second half of the twentieth century up to the present day.
by visiting different sections and reading about factors contributing to the alterations in american food culture, one develops an understanding of how important it is for us to communicate with one another.
exhibitions such as food transforming the american table are great at capturing a students attention while giving them a unique history lesson.
