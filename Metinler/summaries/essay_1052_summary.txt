religious exclusivism is the belief by members of a particular religion or a group that only believers of their faith will see heaven, and other people who believe in other faiths will be condemned to hell.
however, while religious exclusivism may lead to negative consequences, people can practice religious exclusivism today without causing harm or infringing on the rights of other people of different faiths.
until recently, religious killings of people from different religions could be justified.
one of the most apparent problems with religious exclusivism is the ignorance of other peoples religions and beliefs.
in the most extreme cases, religious exclusivity envisions the going to hell of people who do not subscribe to a particular religion, while more moderate religious exclusionists believe the nonbeliever will not receive salvation and hence the heavenly blessings.
