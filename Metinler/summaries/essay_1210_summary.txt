electric cars are better for the future due to the absence of negative impact on the environment since not have harmful substances emission.
electric cars reduce fuel consumption, which will positively impact the exhaustive energy sources issue.
the main argument for the necessity to replace cars with internal combustion engines with electric ones is the degree of influence of vehicles on the environment.
thus, the transition to electric cars has a positive impact not only on the air, usage of resources, and energy but also on the worlds oceans.
modern researches, as well as the work of scientists, formulate arguments for the positive impact of electric cars on the environment and on the future life.
moreover, it is possible to switch to electric engines not only in cars, which provoke the most of emissions among transportation types.
it was found that the difference between the impact on the environment and air of electric cars and ones with combustion engines is significant.
the impact of tribology on energy use and co2 emission globally and in combustion engine and electric cars.
