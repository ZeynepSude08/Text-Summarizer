health care only reaches its full potential when the entire patient is considered, including his family, daily life and culture.
to treat korean patients, a nurse must learn the most important thing about their culture.
language barriers exacerbate all the other challenges nurses face in caring for culturally diverse patients.
this will increase the nurses knowledge of culture, leading to better patient care.
moreover, the nurse can watch educational films and cultural stories, which will help communicate with the patient.
when the patient feels that the nurse is listening and tries to understand their cultural differences, they are more likely to respond positively.
