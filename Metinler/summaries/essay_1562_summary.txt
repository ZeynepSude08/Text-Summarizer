viruses are microorganisms that can only survive and reproduce in the cells of other organisms and, as such, can infect a wide range of living entities, from bacteria to plants, animals, and humans.
according to the other classification, viruses are grouped by the kind of cells that they infect.
these viruses have received increased attention from the academic community since understanding the bacteriophage functioning can lead to their usage as human diseases treatment as an alternative to antibiotics.
to achieve that, the bacterial cells should be mixed with bacteriophage in soft agar in order to examine how the former would create colonies and the latter would form the plaque by destroying bacterial cells.
for instance, t4 bacteriophage attaches either to ompc protein or lipopolysaccharide on the surface of escherichia coli bacteria brzozowka et al.
as for bacteria, those bacteriophages that follow the lysogenic life cycle can impact the cell genome in case lysogenic conversion occurs.
7. the lytic cycle consists of four steps, namely bacteriophage attachment, bacterial cell penetration, replication, and release.
as a consequence, the newly formed bacteriophages leave the bacterium to continue infecting the healthy cells.
this chemical not only helps with cell penetration and infection spread process but also facilitates lysis which is associated with the release of newly formed viruses.
