nevertheless, i did not know that there are institutions to which parents who do not give up parental rights send their disabled children.
so, in boarding schools, children with down syndrome who need help and support are kept locked up, and in some they are immobilized with sedatives.
this idea made me look at institutions for children with down syndrome in a new way.
for me, this idea lacks a description of alternative opportunities for parents of children with down syndrome.
in the studied sources, two variants of the development of events are presented the refusal of parental rights, the permanent residence of the child in a specialized boarding school.
