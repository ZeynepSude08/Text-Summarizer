contemporary sex education is mostly relying on essentialism theory which emphasizes that the sexual characteristics of an individual are influenced by biological factors and are similar in all human cultures.
however, to address the gap in sex education, the training must look at sexuality as being socially constructed, and largely influenced by social norms, culture, personal experience, and interactions kang et al., 2021.
education must give meaning to social construction theory which means that sex is assigned by the society and varies depending on periods and different cultures kang et al., 2021.
the social construction theory holds that neither gender nor sex is binary, meaning there are not just two categories  female or male and are not static kang et al., 2021.
