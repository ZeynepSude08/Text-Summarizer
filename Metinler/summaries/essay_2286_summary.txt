there is potential to harness expertise in predictive modeling and analytics to help local communities and states determine which structural interventions may yield the most meaningful reductions in health disparities.
although individual interventions may have positive effects, the lack of standardized definitions of structural factors and consistent criteria for classifying different sets of relevant interventions and the limited inclusion of process and outcome measures related to health in many of these interventions impede opportunities to compare and evaluate their impact on a range of health disparities.
