given the structural changes in the professional role of the registered nurse, i could not help but take an interest in this field.
thus, my career goal is to pursue a bachelors degree in nursing as the first step to becoming a professional nurse.
additionally, usahs reports that the number of male nurses has tripled over the past 50 years, which also reflects a positive trend in this professional role and rapid removal of stigma.
to emphasize the bottom line, my central career goal is to earn a bachelors degree in registered nursing.
