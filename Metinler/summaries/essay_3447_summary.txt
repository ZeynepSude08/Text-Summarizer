at the same time, from application sciences perspective, transgender studies disclose many possibilities to realize the humans potential in the surgery operations domain and overall peoples curing approaches.
even though natural and applied sciences have fundamentally different objectives, they are both interested in analyzing transgender diversity issues in u.s. society with regard to their specialization.
additionally, the author state that only 20 to 40 of transgender individuals seek genderaffirming surgery, and these numbers are based on questionnaires of a representative sample of transgender people, which considerably limits their generalizability canner et al., 2018.
as a result, the transgender issue might be even the most perspective field of study for applied sciences representatives since the current situation does not demonstrate even half of the possible surgery market size.
in conclusion, despite the differing purposes, the transgender issue in u.s. society is one of the most perspective fields of study in natural and applied sciences.
simultaneously, the authors concern the gender roles by stating the necessity to accommodate the needs of transgender people through the process of gender reassignment that has gained prominence in recent years gardenswartz et al., 2015.
in this case, social sciences helped not only to admit the existence of an issue rather than a single future perspective but also to derive the opportunities for future studies, which plays a pivotal role in addressing transgender diversity in the u.s. society.
