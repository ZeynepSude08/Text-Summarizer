6. the experts calculate that approximately every 3 minutes, an earthquake occurs in california weihaas par.
the largest and deadliest earthquake in american history occurred in san francisco, california, on april 18, 1906.
as a result, the 1906 earthquake was the consequence of the two plates on different sides of the san andreas fault movement and the eventual energy release nash 60.
ultimately, the earthquake in san francisco in 1906 not only demonstrated the destructive force of natural disasters but also provided invaluable information that humanity should use to prevent the repetition of the tragedy.
even though the san francisco earthquake in 1906 is generally recognized as the most devastating one in american history, a large number of smaller ones also occurred in california in the 20th century.
the following large earthquake in california was the long beach earthquake in 1933  the largest earthquake in the central los angeles basin region hough and graves 1.
the earthquake is generally associated with the newportinglewood fault nif however, various studies demonstrated diverse evidence of causes with no affirmative conclusions hough and graves 1.
the earthquake with a moment magnitude of 6.9 m w resulted in the ground deformation of approximately 663 km2 and 60 deaths schmidt et al.
the moment magnitude of the earthquake was m w 6.7, which is similar to the measurements demonstrated by the 1933 and 1989 disasters han et al.
2. the faults commonly occur as a consequence of tectonic plate movement and their friction, which eventually results in seismic activity or earthquakes williams par.
this approach potentially allows identifying hidden faults in the los angeles basin to make better preparation for the following earthquakes svitil 64.
ultimately, the high frequency of earthquakes in california is attributed to its location in the active fault zone.
the current essay has examined four prominent earthquakes that occurred in california in the 20th century and demonstrated the uncertain nature of earthquakes.
californias largest and deadliest earthquake in the 20th century was the 1906 san francisco tragedy, which caused more than 3,000 deaths.
unfortunately, experts predict that an earthquake of a similar scale might occur soon within a 20year old period due to the cyclical nature of earthquakes nash 60.
