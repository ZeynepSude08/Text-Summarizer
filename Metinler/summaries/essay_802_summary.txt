the rapid development of internet communication technologies requires a substantial legal base that will address all minor aspects of the line between personal data privacy and borders for governmental inspection.
it appears that in addition to providing the governmental agencies all users information upon request, ecpa electronic communications privacy act allows conducting inspections in an undercover way, which violates the citizens rights from the first amendment.
it is time to change the ecpa or conduct a new legal base for online communication to reflect the fast development of communication technologies and provide more freedom to citizens.
