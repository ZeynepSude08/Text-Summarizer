determining evaluation standards
it is evident that despite a variety of existing standards that can be applied to any program, evaluators have to make casebycase decisions and utilize criteria suitable for assessing a specific program.
for instance, if local authorities are the primary stakeholders who will utilize evaluation results to justify resource allocation for a specific project, then the standard of utility and the outcome of reach are going to be prioritized above feasibility, propriety, or accuracy.
based on this analysis, evaluators can determine whether certain standards should be applied to a specific project.
thus, the steps for deciding which evaluation standards to utilize include defining the purpose and stakeholders of the program, determining the use and users of the evaluation findings, as well components of the personal logic model used by an evaluator.
