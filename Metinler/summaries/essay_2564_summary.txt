priam reminds achilles that he is still a human, and achilles urges the trojan king not to give up under the misfortunes of war because that is also a part of human nature.
as soon as priam encounters the dreaded achilles in his encampment, he reminds the mighty achaean hero of his father, the elderly king of myrmidons, back home.
yet while his mother is divine, achilless father is as human as everybody else, which is why priam reminds the achaean hero about him.
to convince the dreaded slayer of hector to return the fallen heros body, priam reminds achilles about his human father and, by extension, of his own human nature.
