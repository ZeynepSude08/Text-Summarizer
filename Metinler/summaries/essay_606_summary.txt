the theme of this dance is the traditional culture of the maori people, in particular the expression of joy and gratitude.
in addition to the described dance before the start of the event itself, men and women in the same traditional costumes performed a traditional war dance, which consisted of shouting and clapping.
this mass character and coherence of the dance amazed me, and the artistry of the performers made me immerse myself in the atmosphere of maori culture.
