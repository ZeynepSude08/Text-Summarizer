contributionbased incentive model for physicians essay
during the recent covid19 epidemic, which affected both privately insured and medicare beneficiaries, patients increasingly received healthcare treatments from providers not situated near their doctors.
this paper suggests a new physician compensation model that rewards productivity, quality, and community involvement.
the cbi model combines a secure base salary with configurable core incentives to give physicians more career flexibility.
the cbi model basically works towards motivating the physicians based on their outcomes and quality and offers great career autonomy.
many conditions have to be met before doctors can participate in the bonus structure, including regular clinical activity and productivity in line with the physicians base salary on a fair market value basis.
it is possible to influence physician behavior by varying financing for each core incentive based on the businesss goals, needs, and purposes.
in each core incentive, physicians are classified into quartiles based on their performance.
