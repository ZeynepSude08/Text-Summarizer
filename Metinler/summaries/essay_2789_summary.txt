the article covid19 vaccines safety with rheumatoid arthritis by sissons 2021 discusses the relationship between the covid19 vaccine and rheumatoid arthritis ra.
the authors main concern is the safety of the vaccination for patients who have this autoimmune disorder and the adverse effects that this disease can have on people with ra.
the author alleges that ra subjects people to a more severe covid19 disease flow, which is why these individuals should consider vaccination as a way of protecting them from severe symptoms of covid.
ra typically affects people after their thirties and i think that ra will not affect me in the future, however, according to the cdc n.d., 24 of people in the us have arthritis, and it is the leading cause of disability in the state.
i think that the author of this article has sufficiently discussed the specifics of ra and how covid19 can affect the patients with these conditions, therefore justifying the need for vaccination for patients with ra.
one way of improving this article is by providing more statistics, such as the number of vaccinated individuals in the us, the number of covid19 cases, and the percentage of people affected by ra, which would help strengthen the authors argument.
moreover, ra is a chronic condition, which means that a person affected by it has to learn the practices of selfcare and selfmanagement to address the symptoms and reduce the damage to the joints caused by the inflammation.
for example, dixon and michaud 2018 note that technology allows recording data about ra and the experiences of patients with ra more accurately, which can help advance the treatment development.
