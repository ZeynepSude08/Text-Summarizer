the present paper aims to analyze the national intensive case management and rental assistance program for homeless veterans described by kasprow et al.
the program is assessed using the four principles of community psychology, which include problems addressed, values reflected in the program approach and methods, conceptual foundation of the program, and action and research tools nelson  prilleltensky, 2010.
on the other hand, the program provided intensive case management, which allowed addressing the mental health problems of the participants.
thus, the program aimed to assist veterans with housing problems and mental health issues.
while the program helped many veterans receive financial support and assistance through case management, its effectiveness is questionable.
