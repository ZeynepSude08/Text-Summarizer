as the name suggests, an important part of the conflict was the campaign fought in the crimean peninsula between the defending russians and the expeditionary force of british, french, ottoman, and later sardinian troops.
the battle of alma, fought on 20 september 1854, opened the road to sevastopol and proved the superiority of the allied arms and the french tactics over the cumbersome russian military.
the battle began in the morning of september 20, with the four divisions of the french army advancing against the russian left flank and center.
although the russian artillery fired well and inflicted casualties upon the advancing french, its canister  the only effective type of round against infantry  had roughly the same range as the french rifles baumgart 129.
after that, the british troops renewed the offensive and engaged the russians in heavy fighting that lasted until the french pressure on its left flank and center forced the russian army to retreat.
put together, these figures highlight the superiority of the french tactics and especially the skirmish lines, which made the infantry less vulnerable to massed enemy fire than the russian columns of british lines.
