based on the initial frozen semen sales agreement between the claimant phar lap allevamento and the respondent black beauty equestrian, the claimant, who is also the seller, agreed to provide 100 frozen semen doses.
with cisgs implementation, the accord between black beauty equestrian and phar lap allevamento would avoid any recourse to rules of private international law towards determining the applicable law to the contract.
cisg provides that the claimant has to ensure it conforms to the delivery of the frozen semen in quantity and quality as stipulated in the agreement it made with black beauty equestrian.
initially, the agreement between the claimant and the respondent required 100 frozen semen doses at 100,000, and the payment was in two terms of five million each and a threeterm shipment program.
in light of the imposed tariffs and the breach of contractual agreement by the respondent to resell the semen without the claimants consent, the respondent has the sole reason to pay the amounts.
the claimant was not the party involved in breaching the contract established between it and the respondent, and with that, it should not be the one paying the 1,250,000.
whether or not the frozen semen reached the respondent on time or safe never had a role to play, according to the claimant, in breach of the contract made by the respondent.
however, given that the respondent breached the contractual agreement and needed part of the shipped dose for its commitment to other parties, the claimant has every legal responsibility to renegotiate a contractual agreement with the upcoming third shipment.
further, with the adoption of cisg, the agreement by phar lap allevamento would avoid any recourse to rules of private international law towards determining the applicable law to the contract.
