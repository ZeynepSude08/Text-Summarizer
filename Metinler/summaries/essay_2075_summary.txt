california is called a majorityminority state because its population is made of different minority groups thus, there is no one group that is the majority.
on the contrary, latino and asian populations had higher fertility rates, which in addition were accompanied by an increase in the immigration rate of these racial groups to california.
california has long been the home of the largest immigrant population in the united states, and european explorers arrived at its port as early as the 17th century.
