iterative solutions use a sequential search that utilizes repeated actions or loops, while recursion uses a binary search to divide the problem.
binary search through the integers or dictionary is conducted through the recursive binary search function that includes the array and the target information.
recursion can be used for searching an array or valued and void functions.
