the problem of data breaches is a topical one for accountable care organizations operating in the healthcare system, which requires them to take preventive measures.
currently, there are several effective strategies for identifying risk financing issues, such as the threat of a data breach in healthcare providers.
in other words, healthcare providers can hire an agency with expertise in data security to conduct an independent assessment of the organizations level of preparedness.
the main way to finance risk and minimize future losses in relation to data breach issues is to invest heavily in the organizations infrastructure.
the type of insurance provided to organizations which want to finance their risk associated with data breaches is called cyberinsurance.
thus, providers such as hospitals can utilize cyberinsurance to finance the data breach risk or other security incidents which are common in the healthcare industry.
