florida emerged in 1966 as students decided to protest civil rights issues at the local private stateowned jail.
the students have unsuccessfully appealed, and the case has reached the supreme court in an attempt to determine if constitutional rights have been violated.
meanwhile, the state argued that students were trespassing and charged the protesters under the statute of trespassing with malicious intent.
the group strongly argued that their first and fourteenth amendment rights were violated, although there was no evidence of any unfair action by the lower courts, which simply reaffirmed the state trespassing statute.
these cases also came before the supreme court and held in favor of the protesters, indicating that their rights were violated by the unconstitutional application of vague laws vile, n.d.
the statute was determined to be specific and constitutional, fully applicable here, given the jail was on private property and not a location open to the public, in addition to the security concerns the protests were creating.
the supreme court ultimately supported that there was ample evidence for arrest based on the florida statute of trespassing with malicious intent.
as known in this case, the court reaffirmed that the jail was the states private property and they could do what they wished, including applying its own trespassing law.
it pushed the discussion as to where civil rights protests could take place and how without the protesters facing arrests for vaguely applied laws.
