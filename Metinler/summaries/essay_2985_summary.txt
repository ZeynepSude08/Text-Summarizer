the type of study can be best described as a metaanalysis and systematic review of prospective and case studies on dietary intake and the blood concentration of antioxidants such as vitamins c and e and carotenoids in relation to cardiovascular rr aune et al., 2018.
therefore, researchers conducted a metaanalysis of nutritional intake and blood concentrations of vitamin c and e and carotenoids, including carotene, lycopene, and cryptoxanthin aune et al., 2018.
the results for the assessment of vitamin c intake showed that for coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, cumulative cancer, stroke, and death, statistically significant reductions in the rr of 12, 11, 7, 8, and 11 percent were detected aune et al., 2018, p.1071.
the results further indicated that carotenoid intake was associated with a 12, 15, and 20 reduction of rr for mortality, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular disease aune et al., 2018, p.
vitamin e showed no association with the conditions under test, and no association was found between carotenoids and stroke with reference to carotenoids concentration in blood, an association of 17 and 31 percent was observed for mortality and coronary heart disease rrs aune et al., 2018, p.1071.
