arguably, one could say that soldiers in the military might not need the church however, in the setting as rigid and demanding as the military, the presence of an opportunity for spiritual growth is one of the essential options for supporting the soldiers morale.
therefore, by offering spiritual support and opportunities for spiritual development, a christian chaplain will be able to improve the performance of soldiers and build a strong sense of loyalty and responsibility in them, thus, giving them a purpose.
for instance, in the situations that i will find particularly challenging, the focus on responsibility and acceptance of the authority of the superior will help me to convince the troops to accept specific values and ideas even if the soldiers do not have the necessary cultural or spiritual background needed to embrace the complexity of a specific concept or idea.
in turn, the standards of the christian church will help me to remain patient and understanding of the needs of soldiers so that they could progress in their spiritual development.
