the topic of the proposed research is to assess how neural stem cells replace and differentiate into neurons and other cells of the brain in order to use them for therapeutic purposes.
4. neural stem cell differentiation.
1. in other words, distantly located cells secrete a wide range of signaling molecules to regulate the neural stem cell generation, differentiation, and regeneration processes.
neural stem cells origin, heterogeneity and regulation in the adult mammalian brain .
quiescence of adult mammalian neural stem cells a highly regulated rest .
