when using mission reliability, it takes a short time to complete large amounts of work compared to onetime operational reliability which takes a long time due to quality limitations.
the component reliability increases the mission safety while minimizing the dependability of the logistics due to the high demand rate.
according to catelani et al., 2018, the reliability and maintenance policy should be adopted during the design and operational period to minimize failure and preserve system functionality.
