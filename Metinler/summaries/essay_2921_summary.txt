the primary goal of this report is to provide a complete overview of all procedures involved in conducting a realworld linear regression model as a form of research study, from generating a subject of study through carrying out a detailed quantitative model for statistical analysis and evaluating the results.
this is detailed, focusing on the use of the linear regression model in carrying out the prediction of the housing prices for specified homes in 2019.
on the other hand, the scatter plot refers to a form of graphic or statistical layout that displays data for various parameters for a collection of data using the coordinates from the cartesian plane.
figure 1 the sampling data with the display of the response and the predictor variables.
the predictorindependent variable is the square footage from the data collected, while the responsedependent variable is the house price.
from figure 4 above, the total mean displayed from the listing price is 218, 974, mean price per square foot is 136, as indicated.
figure 5 the graph representation of the listing price and the price per square parameters.
the investigators find it much simpler to carry out their analysis by using the linear regression models, which play a significant role in statistics.
