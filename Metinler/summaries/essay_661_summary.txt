social inequality in the gilded age and progressive era
in this paper, i look at the social injustices suffered by minority communities in these eras, how they sought to solve them, and the coverage of these critical periods of american history in the textbooks.
loewens assessment of the coverage of these inequalities in textbooks
he says there is a general absence of class analysis in american history textbooks.
loewen also implies that class bias in textbooks has been used as a tool to keep the rich getting their pockets deeper as they deserve it and for the working class to accept their position in society.
with todays society looking ever so close to being a second gilded age, textbooks should be at the front of ensuring that social inequality does not recur.
