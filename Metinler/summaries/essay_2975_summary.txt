for example, an ordinary reader may not understand the differences between the newtonian and pseudoplastic behaviors, and extra search is required to learn the main idea of the chosen article piednoir et al ., 2020.
in the article, the authors provide a solid background about rheology modifiers and the properties of caesalpinia spinosa gum.
another strength of the introductory section is the discussion of caesalpinia spinosa gum, also known as peruvian carob and a representative of the leguminosae family rigano et al ., 2019.
in general, the reader gets a clear idea of the rheology modifier category and understands the urgency of using caesalpinia spinosa gum as a new gelling agent in the cosmetics field.
on the one hand, the authors do not describe what research design they choose to explain why caesalpinia spinosa gum could be an effective gelling agent and rheology modifier in cosmetic products.
for example, in an aqueous solution, caesalpinia spinosa gum showed pure newtonian behavior, meaning that viscosity did not change and the gum did not possess thixotropic characteristics rigano et al., 2019.
during the compatibility trials, it was revealed that caesalpinia spinosa gum is exposed to high compatibility with other ingredients with a stable ph range rigano et al., 2019.
the authors explain the optimal concentration of caesalpinia spinosa gum for avoiding unnecessary gommage effects between 0.1 and 1 rigano et al ., 2019.
the authors give several recommendations on how to use the obtained forms of caesalpinia spinosa gum, including lightgreen paste for toothpaste, slightly opaque fluid for cleansing formulas, or skincolored fluid emulsion for skin products rigano et al.
no additional questions or concerns about caesalpinia spinosa gum as a rheology modifier occur after reading this section of the article.
