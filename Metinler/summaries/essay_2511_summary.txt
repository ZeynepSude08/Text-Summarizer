platos allegory of the cave and aristotles highminded man essay
there are two significant concepts from the works of ancient philosophers plato and aristotle that discuss the sources of knowledge and its correlation with happiness and meaningful life.
aristotles perception of life examination suggests that people develop and achieve knowledge, happiness, and success by cultivating virtuous habits.
while platos theory explores the point of view of only one person, aristotles work suggests that everyone should try to become a highminded man as it forms a foundation for societys overall development.
therefore, platos allegory of the cave defines society as an opposition to the knowledgeable philosopher, while aristotles concept of the highminded man presents the knowledgeable one as the model society should follow.
aristotles idea of a highminded man suggests that a person must examine himself and his life to develop and gain knowledge about the world and its place in it.
