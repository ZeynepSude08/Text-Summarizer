there are extremely few films that explore not only female friendships but also delve into the interpersonal connection of women, seeking to escape the restrictions of gender, class, time, and place.
it is a pity that they do not make strong films about womens struggles in hollywood anymore that is why it remains to revise thelma and louise from year to year.
these stereotypical films are forgotten and will never become a symbol of the female spirit, which thelma and louise became precisely because it reflects the true womans need for freedom.
indeed, in addition to the motif of freedom and independence, thelma and louise unfold with a feminist approach, making women as strong as men.
as for the ted talk by stacy smith, indeed, the situation regarding the role of women in the film industry is disastrous.
