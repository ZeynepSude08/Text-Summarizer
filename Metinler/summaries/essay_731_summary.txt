many rightwing politicians ascribe the man to be in favor of a meritbased society, where both black and white people are only viewed through the lens of individual choices.
one can even surmise that carson favors understanding society as the result of singular peoples choices, rather than a result of systematic interactions.
in addition, the scapegoat theory may be relevant to the way carson understands the issue of racial equity, as well as the critical race theory.
similar to this theory, the man assumes that certain political actors blame the white population for the perceived failings of black people while failing to consider the effect of individual choices and dispositions.
in carsons mind, ideas such as progressive learning and crt lead to people in the us blaming white people for the majority of problems inside the us.
moving over to the discussion more focused on ben carson himself, the man has also been influenced by power in a way that changes his attitude.
firstly, it is important to note that ben carson has been largely working for fox news and other conservative media, relaying his political standing and public persona.
carson rejects critical race theory and modern policies built to promote equity, instead favoring an individualistic promotion of the status quo.
in conclusion, it can be said that opinionated articles, such as the one written by ben carson exist as a method of adapting existing social critiques into a conservative lens, changing them to suit the desired narrative.
in particular, carson rejects the rhetoric introduced by the black lives matter movement and critical race theory.
