this recognized painting titled starry night by the infamous vincent van gogh was created near saintrmydeprovence in 1889 while the author stayed at the asylum of saintpauldemausole.
the emphasis on the big bright sky may represent van goghs desire to fly away from his reality and embrace the light of the starry night.
