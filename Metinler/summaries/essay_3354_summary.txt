to make such an argument regarding the poem, one would need to have a deep understanding of the cultural context of the poem and the lives of the natives.
this essay argued that the understanding of the canadian native culture appears to be too shallow, which could only make the poem a piece for sales and entertainment.
the argument presented above is based on the understanding of the canadian natives association with the great spirit.
therefore, the sharp contrast between crawfords understanding of canadian native culture and the actual cultural beliefs and practices supports the notion that her knowledge on the subject is shallow.
such a behavior can be seen in crawford attempting to use her own understanding of the great spirit to depict what she thinks is the reality among the natives.
besides the reference to the great manitou, it can be argued that there are images created in the poem that can hardly be associated with the canadian natives.
in conclusion, crawfords poem has been shown to be intended for sales and entertainment as opposed to a serious expression of the canadian native culture.
