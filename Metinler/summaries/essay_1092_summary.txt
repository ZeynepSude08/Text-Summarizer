it is necessary to analyze the properties and causes of the disease and also to identify how much attention is paid to the science of combating cardiomyopathy.
cardiomyopathy is a disease associated with a gradual increase in the volume of the left ventricle and, as a consequence, resulting in the formation of heart failure.
heart disease can be acute or chronic it is quite common, and a similar pathology is found in 58 of citizens moretti and erdmann 134.
the first type is a violation of the heart chambers, and their expansion is referred to as dilated cardiomyopathy it is the most common and very difficult.
an abnormal enlargement of the heart is called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy moretti and erdmann 98.
the disease associated with the restriction of blood flow into the aorta from the left ventricle belongs to the obstructive type of cardiomyopathy.
after determining the type of disease and the underlying causes, the cardiologist selects the appropriate therapy and prescribes a course of treatment moretti and erdmann 99.
with regard to cardiomyopathy, the prognosis is unfavorable the steady progression of heart failure becomes the cause of a high probability of arrhythmic and thromboembolic complications, as well as the sudden death of the patient.
surgical treatment, for example, for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, gives a positive result but is associated with a high risk of death of the patient during or after surgery.
