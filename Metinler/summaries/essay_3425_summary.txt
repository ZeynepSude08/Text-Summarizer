according to sykes, mtdna is a type of dna that is only succeeded by the mother, and from the hypothesis, this genetic material enables researchers to formulate matrilineal family trees.
sykes found out that tracing back ancestral mothers can be done by analyzing infinitesimal variations found in the mtdna of individuals and can be used in finding others with the same genetic blueprint.
inheriting this genetic material helped sykes form a basis for creating dna trees for humans and this enabled him to trace the origin of individuals as he was doing investigations in a mass grave.
sykes classified modern europeans into seven groups by tracing their maternal line tied to a specific ancient woman referred to as clan mothers.
it is the development of mtdna that enabled sykes to trace and guess about the lives of the clan mothers since through it he was able to assess the genetic makeup of modern europeans baqueromndez et al., 2021.
