therefore, all team members must understand the projects purpose and scope.
as for me, i would also include in this chapter such categories of guidelines as agreedupon rules for holding meetings, discussing problems, and communications among team members.
thus, the team chapter with such categories of guidelines will be a key to the successful implementation of the project.
realizing the scope and purpose of the project by all team members is one of the obligatory conditions of working on the task.
