the project i last worked on as part of my professional life involved a small tracking program that helped customers identify the location of their package in real time.
finally, the scope of the project was revolving around customer expectations, with the objective being to provide the necessary minimum they sought to receive, for their estimated budget.
the project was successful, as we managed to achieve all the objectives placed by the customer professor before us, while producing a marketable product.
