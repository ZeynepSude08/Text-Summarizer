nevertheless, the most notable examples of such documentaries are the two series titled history of africa with zeinab badawi and africans a triple heritage by ali mazrui.
unlike history of africa, africans a triple heritage has only nine episodes which nevertheless provide a substantial level of knowledge to the audience.
in each episode of africans a triple heritage, ali mazrui focuses on the core idea of africa being a place of confluence of three civilizations which were mentioned above.
history of africa with zeinab badawi is the opposite of africans a triple heritage since it strictly relies on an academic perspective on the history of africa.
while ali mazrui sticks to his own opinion, zeinab badawi invites real experts, including historians, to explain various topics related to the history of africa and its traditions.
nevertheless, zeinab badawis documentary still covers more topics from african history simply due to the fact that the series includes more episodes.
