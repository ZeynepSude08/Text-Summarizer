when any products are processed, the oceans and waters suffer first and foremost, and the food industry is no exception.
it is necessary to analyze in more detail the role of data in solving the issue of environmental pollution by the food industry.
this is essential for realtime streaming data and can be applied to the evaluation of ecoefficiency within the food industry.
2021, it is feasible to work on the ecological efficiency of industrial production and advance development plans for sustainability using datadriven evaluation and optimization.
the method involves the data gathering and processing of the industrial production systems from the standpoint of energy  the quantity of directly or indirectly used energy for production liu et al., 2021.
the relationship between numerous elements and ecoefficiency is investigated, and a datedriven ecoefficiency optimization choice is developed to increase industrial outputs ecoefficiency and production advantages liu et al., 2021.
with all the variety of technological processes, equipment, and raw materials, all food production enterprises have common features, which are determined by the processing of organic raw materials, the use of finished products in food, and often without pretreatment.
in the enterprises of this industry, due to the use of many different types of raw materials and methods of its processing, almost all types of harmful waste occur.
it is thanks to analytical work and data as a research tool that the presence of contamination from the food industry has been identified.
data driven ecoefficiency evaluation and optimization in industrial production .
