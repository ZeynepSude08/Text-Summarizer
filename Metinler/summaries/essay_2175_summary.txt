more specifically, since the membrane is permeable to potassium ions  and their concentration is known to be equal to that of dissociable potassium chloride  an electrochemical potassium potential will be created between the systems boundless, 2020.
the chlorine ions will move along the concentration gradient, and their generalized movement will stop when the same concentration of chlorine exists in each of the two systems.
