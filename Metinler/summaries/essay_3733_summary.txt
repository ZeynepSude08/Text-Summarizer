based on that, the author argues that rich people should get rid of their wealth for the poor ones.
the redistribution of wealth will not imply the transfer of skills in financial management to the impoverished thus, people who will obtain that redistributed money will likely waste them.
from that perspective, people who were able, based on their skills, to earn money should get rid of them for the sake of those who do not have those skills.
