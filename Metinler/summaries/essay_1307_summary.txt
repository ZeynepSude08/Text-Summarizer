ma and kim, who move to the us from hong kong with the help of aunt paula, feel the obligation to repay their debt to aunt paula by working in the fabric factory.
while as a child going to a regular school, kim does not feel the burden of translating herself according to the environment she finds herself in.
now, kim feels like she cannot change enough to fit with her new classmates without changing too much for her community back home.
the toxic influence of aunt paula, along with the challenge of being accepted in the community, naturally makes kim question why, of all people, she needs to constantly balance between the two versions of herself the kim that must be forever grateful to aunt paula and work hard for minimum wage, and the kim who is headoverhills in love and cherishes her dream of being successful.
however, despite the obstacles in the way, kim eventually becomes the one to break the factory circle without losing the person she is.
