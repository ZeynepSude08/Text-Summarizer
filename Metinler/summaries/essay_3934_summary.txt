to avoid negative consequences for uncollectible accounts receivables, an effective allowance method can be used.
the allowance method consists of assessing and accounting of bad debts when the debtor is unable to pay a certain amount.
applying the allowance method implies that the assessment of expenses on bad debts is reflected in the same reporting period in which sales on credit and accounts receivable are taken into account.
