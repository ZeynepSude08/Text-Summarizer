all the people, according to ghalib, are the result of creation that would not have mattered if they existed or not without god.
ghalib states that god has always been there for a human, and even if there is no hope and it seems that the world has ended, god will be there to help each soul.
the poem the godless lover underlines the attitude of ghalib to god and gods connection to human beings.
