robert came to a mental health facility to get treated for anxiety, but it soon turned out that he rather struggled with ocd because he strongly smelled of disinfectant and reported excessive cleaning behaviors.
overall, robert does not have a dependency on other people when it comes to handling his ocd and prefers being on his own the majority of the time.
