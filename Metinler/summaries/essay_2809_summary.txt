the catholic church has concealed the perversions of its priests and, in turn, condemned their victims to drug addiction, strained sexual relationships and disturbed sexual behavior, loss of their belief in god, and painful flashbacks.
the ignorance of the church and failure to report pedophile priests to authorities so they can be prosecuted is one of the major reasons that so many children still suffer sexual abuse.
disturbed sexual behavior and strained relationships are psychological consequences of abuse for victims dressing et al.
in the longterm, the victims experience effects in the form of strained sexual relationships, disturbed risky sexual behavior, loss of trust and faith in god and the church, drug addiction, and flashbacks.
some of these effects can be prevented, and victims can be spared a lot of hurt if the catholic church can stop its ignorance and coverups of child sexual abuse.
