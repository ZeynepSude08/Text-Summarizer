the recent advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence have the potential to automate a wide range of human activities and to dramatically reshape the way people live and work in the coming decades.
initially, robots were only limited to the manufacturing industry, but today they are increasingly becoming part of peoples everyday tasks.
overall, robots increases productivity by performing tasks at a faster rate but with the same consistent level of quality and quantity than humans.
in fact, it is common to find robots that move at a high speed than humans making them more preferable in ensuring fast production lines,especially in manufacturing companies.
a good example of how robots work by improving speed is in the case of factory automation system inc., located in atlanta which is part of the architectural, engineering, and related services industry mena report, 2021.
which uses reciprocating painting machine to paint car and truck on the same line yaskawa, 2021.with human tendency, the company used to get different and mixed results as far as production is concerned, but since the adoption of robots, product quality and perfection have improved greatly.
