however, it is not clear whether or not the use of threats is effective during the negotiation process since it has both advantages and drawbacks.
the given analysis will primarily assess if threats are effective during the negotiation process.
for example, in the context of negotiations, a persons threats can be more effective if used against people with high fts rather than low fts.
therefore, the typology and characteristics of an opponent can play a critical role in influencing the general effectiveness of threats in the negotiation process.
in conclusion, threats are a form of negotiation measure, which can be effective under a specific set of conditions.
firstly, threats effectiveness is determined by their inherent strength and a proponents perceived credibility.
therefore, threats should only be used if a proponent does not plan to negotiate with an opponent and related parties in the future, has the credibility and power to do so, and uses them against high fts individuals.
