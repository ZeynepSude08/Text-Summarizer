delegation is the key to success in any type of organization, yet it can be a serious problem in church management.
key stakeholders are senior pastoral leadership, specific church leadership elders, deacons, and volunteer leaders appointed to participate in the delegation process.
if inexperienced leaders make fatal leadership mistakes, decreased attendance and less employee satisfaction with their time in the church are expected.
delegating authority and various tasks in the christian church is an essential skill that every leader must possess.
by delegating to others, church leaders are actually allowing them to serve.
delegation of authority can improve the functioning of the church and make it easier to serve young leaders who do not yet have all the skills needed for successful leadership.
