the connection between human life and its absurdity essay
the main issue considered under this theme is the connection between human life and its absurdity.
thomas nagel, in his work, investigates a concern about the inescapable absurdity of human lives and analyzes the nature of this phenomenon.
life in nagels view, is absurd on a large scale, so some might argue it becomes inescapably meaningless.
this proves that any effort humans apply to every action in their life could be pointless and, therefore, absurd.
therefore, to decrease the absurdity of life, humans should have a goal or be part of something significant.
in conclusion, nagel perfectly shows the absurdity of life and how it is inescapable.
at the universe scale, human life is absurd, and the final point of existence is not defined.
