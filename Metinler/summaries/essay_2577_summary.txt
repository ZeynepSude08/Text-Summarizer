many expectant mothers are humiliated by the gestation age provision of the constitution, which states that abortion should not be conducted on a woman at her eightweek gestation period or afterward rubin, 2020.
because the law denied women the ability to choose when to abort on their own, the case was brought to the court for an appeal of the gestational age provisions.
except in circumstances when abortion is performed at 14, 18, or 20 weeks of gestation, sections 188.375, 188.058, and 188.057 are identical to the first legislative provision thomas et al., 2016.
rhs petitioned for a preliminary injunction, asserting that the gestation age stipulations prevented them from providing previability abortion services to missouri clients.
the district court ruled that the two provisions, gestational age and down syndrome, ought to be prohibited instead of simply being controlled.
missouri asked the district court for a temporary restraining order because the ruling forbids abortions done after 20 weeks of pregnancy thomas et al., 2016.
the supreme court heard missouris case, in which certain grounds were presented against the gestational age regulations and the down syndrome stipulations.
the district court, however, denied missouris motion to forbid categorical abortions due to a lack of evidence on the legislation.
