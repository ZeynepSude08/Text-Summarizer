religion has a social function that encourages people to believe in their selfworth yet maintain a collective effort towards a greater good.
it is certain that many people view religion as a way of feeling loved, cared about, and valued by family members, friends, and communities.
since religion itself is closely tied to the notion of value that each person has, people with a set of beliefs have to be empathetic towards individuals who cannot find this value within themselves.
