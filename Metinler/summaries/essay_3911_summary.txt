therefore, to manage the problem of diabetes in the specified audience, a program geared toward increasing patient literacy, promoting awareness, and introducing tools for monitoring the exposure to diabetes in the target population will be developed.
due to the active focus on prevention and threat management, as well as the active support of patients that have already developed diabetes, the program in question is believed to produce a noticeably positive effect on the levels of wellbegin within the target community.
the program in question will target the local community so that it could assist not only hispanic people with diabetes but also support those that have not yet developed the disorder despite the continuous exposure to it.
in order to fully address the needs of hispanic people at risk of developing diabetes, the program will be based on the slp principles outlined in the paper by scarinci et al.
similarly, in the program at hand, the needs of hispanic patients with diabetes will be considered through the prism of the key specifics of the community, as well as the cultural background of the patients.
due to the lack of awareness concerning the causes and risks of diabetes development, as well as increased exposure to it in the target population, the proposed program aimed at increasing the rates of health awareness and introducing nurses to improved guidelines is strongly needed for the target community.
