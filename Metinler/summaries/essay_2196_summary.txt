therefore, both familybased and schoolbased drug prevention programs have been put into use.
this paper evaluates drug prevention programs used in the community today to reduce substance abuse in society and highlights the shortcomings and advantages of each program and its effectiveness.
most evidencebased approaches for the youths and adolescents on drug use prevention are developed and tested in schools.
new schoolbased programs focused on the causes of substance misuse among teenagers as well as the prevention of abuse at an earlier stage before they were addicted to drugs or other substances.
the social resistance approach to the prevention of drug use aims to strengthen the refusal skills among children and youths to ensure they are able to resist the social pressures and drug consumption.
this approach focuses on teaching students to avoid peer pressure and social acts which may lead them to drug use singh et al., 2011.
the shortcoming of the social resistance approach was that it assumed the students do not want to use drugs thus preventing them from being encouraged to do drugs.
however, the familybased approach has been a successful to drug the prevention of drug abuses and use.
