through the involvement of sources considering exploratory date analysis as well as its effective visualization, the practical usefulness of such a methodological innovation as the data driven in the food industry is proved.
this article clearly demonstrates how date processing can visualize a picture of social and material situation on a colossal scale and describes modern food production at the global level in statistical dimensions.
the use of publicly available statistical data allows the authors of the article to develop a strategy for changing the type of food supply to adapt to the changed economic and ecological climate.
using data and visual indicators, researchers prove the real impact of the greenhouse effect and global warming on crops and the food industry around the world.
this study uses more than 16,000 pieces of global data collected from various local surveys and studies in order to draw up a real statistical picture of the impact of agricultural areas on the earths atmosphere.
this article aims to demonstrate the statistical efficiency of using big data for forecasting and proving processes on a global scale.
