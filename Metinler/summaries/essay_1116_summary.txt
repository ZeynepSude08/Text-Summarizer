when teaching students with peculiar languagerelated needs, for instance, duallanguage learners dlls, it is pivotal to organize ones use of talking to encourage childrens active participation in conversations.
with that in mind, to maximize childrens participation and language use, i can incorporate classroom activities and games requiring switching a language quickly, translating notions expressed in images in another language, and so on.
as an example, instead of announcing the transition to another activity in a verbal form, i can invent a sign or a gesture for it and create a related rule requiring children to use language.
