for animal or human reproductive cloning, the process is complex.
the clone develops in the womb and eventually, the adult female gives birth, with the new clone having an identical genetic makeup to the organism from which the somatic cell originated national human genome research institute, 2021.
therefore, the conjecture is that the combination of human cloning using somatic cell nuclear transfer is the primary issue at hand.
