narcotic anonymous meetings have approximately the same structure as alcohol anonymous meetings, but they still differ and can be described as separated types of salvation for addicted people.
the literature used during narcotic meetings does not say that stop using drugs will make your life better, but it says that the person will receive freedom from active addiction.
surprisingly, the meeting was attended by many people of different conditions, and all were treated equally.
