as a matter of fact, renewable energy that includes wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, ocean, geothermal, or biofuel energy, may be regarded as a highly essential power generation source in the nearest future due to its efficiency and the impact on ecosystems.
at the same time, wind energy may have a negative effect on wildlife through the constructions for its generation.
thus, regardless of the fact that renewable energy cannot be regarded as completely safe, its impact on ecosystems is less negative and may be mitigated more due to proper strategies of constructions location and hazardous material utilization.
