the peak of the infection is the point at which the epidemic transmits at a higher rate than normal.
the peak is the time that the disease transmits at a higher rate, and the individuals in the population are at the highest risk of infection.
since the infected individuals are secluded and taken to icu beds, where they get treatment while in confinement, the contact rate is reduced, making it possible to lower the rate of infection in the target population.
this portrays that without the utilization of covers, the epidemic rate is high along these lines, making it difficult for the access number of icu beds to meet the demand.
