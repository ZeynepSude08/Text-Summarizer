specifically, the effects of two variables at once were evaluated the proportion of white plumage on the brown coloration of male birds and the concentration of 2pentadecanone in the reproductive secretion of individuals.
it follows from this that in contrast to the coloration of birds, female juncos could pay attention to the smell of males in the mating season first of all because the secreted secretion possessing the odor of attractiveness contained an increased amount of the organic component.
confirmed that the volatile compounds of junco birds are reliable predictors of reproductive success in male birds 698.
indeed, the fact that a consistent relationship has been found between the physiological traits of male birds and their reproductive attractiveness signifies the specific effects of natural selection.
it can be expected that, over time, the number of male birds whose glands produce small amounts of 2pentadecanone during the mating season will slowly decline.
