further, the research would also look at the speed of string waves in an air column and identify the degree of the sound pace.
using the values of the ones, we additionally calculated the usual distance, the wavelength, the velocity, and the tension within the string.
as we had the wavelengths, we calculated the speed of the wave using
the frequency of this investigation was 120 hz, and i had different values for the wavelength, due to which we were able to calculate speed, and the error in the speed was calculated using the formula
we then measured these values, which helped us find the period, wavelength of the wave, and speed of the sound.
