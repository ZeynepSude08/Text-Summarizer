the authors call their study a project, and investigators and doctors randomly selected a group of children for it.
the studys design is considered quasiexperimental, as the authors included the results of a survey of physicians in the conclusions of the study.
the authors conducted qualitative research, which first ascertained screening quality in a pediatric hospital before the intervention.
secondly, the authors aimed to improve the quality of screening in the hospital and increase the likelihood of detecting a tendency to obesity in children.
the studys design is similar to the authors goals and differs from the more theorized studies of umer et al.
an extensive literature review was not necessary for the authors however, they gave a vivid introduction about childhood obesity at the beginning of the article, in general, citing statistical data.
the authors identified no specific surveillance tools researchers are public health professionals and physicians the data are mainly presented on an ordinal scale, where respondents had to mark the degree of agreement.
the authors did not provide measures of central tendency, but only approximately one in three children in the cohort 36.7 were screened before the intervention after their intervention, this result was more than 90.
the authors note the smallness of the study and suggest that if the study involved perhaps more than 100 children, the results would be more varied.
2017 and mrginean et al.s 2018 studies similarly collected data but did not have a supervised group of children.
studies do not assume probabilistic data as the authors do not calculate probabilities.
researchers did not explicitly state the hypothesis, but the authors argued that following uspstf standards should improve screening among children.
the authors successfully investigated the local problem of obesity in one hospital and achieved the desired results.
