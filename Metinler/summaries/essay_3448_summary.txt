military chaplains are engaged in spiritual and educational work and participate in events held by the command for patriotic and moral education of servicemen and their family members.
the chaplain can still provide when they can not actually perform because a soldier has a different faith or religious belief.
thus, a chaplain can be guided by universal moral principles when instructing a person from another religion.
