only years later, it was discovered that aids was only a late stage of hiv infection when those infected with hiv develop serious, potentially fatal lesions.
to be sure of this, doctors had to observe patients with hiv infection for the whole 20 years.
the hiv infection progresses, secondary diseases develop, which in most cases end in the patients death.
stereotypes against people with hiv hastens the progression of the disease and worsens its outcomes by making untimely medical attention available to those who are ill.
no one currently doubts that along with the purely medical aspects of the epidemiology and treatment of hiv infection, the development of effective programs to prevent the spread of the disease is a pressing issue.
therefore, increasing public awareness of hiv infection and implementing timely and effective preventive measures in all population groups is necessary.
