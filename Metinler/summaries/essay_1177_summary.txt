thus, the main point of difference between cultural criminology and other theories of crime is that it places criminality and control over it in a specific context that can be interpreted differently when viewed from varied perspectives.
that is, the theory views crime and the relevant agencies and institutions of crime control as cultural products or as creative constructs.
to facilitate an understanding of cultural criminology, it is essential to consider such ideas as crime as culture, culture as crime, the media constructions of crime control and corruption, and political dimensions of culture, crime, and cultural criminology.
culture as crime is a thematic area of cultural criminology that entails the criminalization of cultural products and players.
the thematic area of focus, which entails the political dimension of culture, crime, and cultural criminology, is concerned with the analysis of power relations in which social control, media, and crime stand.
