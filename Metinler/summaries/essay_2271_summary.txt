i propose a solution to these issues in a private initiative, greentower, which is to create lowcost and semiautomated vertical farming systems in areas inhabited by predominantly unprotected migrant families.
however, my project aims to solve this problem by placing vertical farms within such urban areas and leasing them to migrants and vulnerable groups of the population.
it is also vital that vertical farms use led lighting, which is colossally cheaper than uv lamps bayer ag, n.d., rising to the sustainability challenge.
cheapness, efficiency, and the possibility of accommodation even in densely populated areas of large cities make vertical farms convenient for migrants to start a business with a medium income.
consequently, the mass use of vertical farms would enhance the level of integration in a country and its internal production rates.
to conclude, the recent issue of uncontrollable migration and difficulties of foreign population integration could be solved through vertical farming use.
