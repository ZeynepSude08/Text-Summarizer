it means that the distribution of various physical features, such as forests and water landscapes, among the location of the natural resources mines affect the distribution of populations.
the abundance of natural resources and the presence of different physical features might help not only to follow the trends of the global population but also to predict its movement and distribution of it.
the environment also influences people for example, the movement of the population is impacted by the distribution of natural resources and physical objects.
such factors as the distribution of resources, location of the physical objects, industrialization, trades, and natural resource demands influence the movement of the population.
the development of strategies, both political and geographical, has a role in interpreting and analyzing the influence of humans on landscapes and the influence of environmental factors on population.
