the influenza viruses are typically known to cause acute respiratory infections such as sore throat, nonproductive cough, fever, and malaise.
the major virulence factors in the influenza virus are hemagglutinin ha spike proteins and neuraminidase.
it also helps in releasing the viral genome into the epithelial cells cytoplasms through membrane fusion, thus initiating the respiratory infection.
