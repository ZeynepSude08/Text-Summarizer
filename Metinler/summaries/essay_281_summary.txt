de jong and zawaydeh 2002 address this phonetic issue on the basis of the arabic language, attempting to observe a potential effect of quantity and voicing duration on the vowel duration and describe this influence.
the key research question that is pursued by the authors is whether stress, lexical focus, and segment focus have an observable effect on the quantity and voicing of the speech.
the findings of the article support the initially advanced hypothesis of the theorized effect of stress, lexical focus, and segmental focus on the durations of vowels.
