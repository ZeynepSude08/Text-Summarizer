serving as the pivoting point in douglass perception of his situation, his fight with covey made him realize the necessity to fight back as the only possible response to the atrocities of slavery and the inhumane treatment that he and other african american people received from the white population.
namely as douglass recalls in his memoir, others witnessing his resistance and willingness to fight sled slaves to believe that opposing slavery was a possibility.
specifically, the institution of slavery crumbled in the eyes of the african american people witnessing the fight the moment when douglass threw the first punch against covey.
the described alteration in the general perception of slavery in the african americans observing douglass fighting is expressed very accurately and vividly as he mentions the other black man refusing to cooperate with covey to punish douglass.
even though a significant number of the african americans witnessing the fight between covey and douglass also observed him being entirely defeated by his opponent.
