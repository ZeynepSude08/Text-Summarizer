for homeless people, the only medical care is being provided by hospital emergency departments.
the complexity of caring for homeless people and the issues that led them to this state requires a highly coordinated partnership of major healthcare organizations.

the change that can both provide effective care for homeless people and relocate the budget, making the most use of the money spent should be aimed at the longterm result.
