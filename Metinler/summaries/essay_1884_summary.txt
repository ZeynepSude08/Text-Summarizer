it differs from ordinary hyaluronic acid in the size of the molecule.
small nanoparticles of hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid penetrate the deep layers of the epidermis, filling the skin with moisture, improving its appearance and complexion.
sodium hyaluronate is a salt of hyaluronic acid, isolated in the laboratory through hydrolysis, detachment from the molecule of ineffective components chiu et al., 2018.
this is an innovative active complex that contains hyaluronic acid molecules of different sizes molecular weight, which provides a prolonged threedimensional effect on all levels of the skin at the same time.
however, it should be mentioned that products containing hyaluronic acid make up about 5 juncan et al., 2021.
at the same time, although 3d hyaluronic acid has become more actively used in cosmetic procedures, the percentage of its use is small and amounts to about 12 zhang et al., 2018.
hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid penetrates the skin without injection due to the size of the molecules and moisturizes the skin.
3d hyaluronic acid works as a complex containing molecules of different sizes.
