this paper, therefore, explains and suggests the appropriate way of distributing the machine allocated maintenance hours that would enhance machine reliability, availability, and production output.
however, this plan gives sound production output since maintenance only takes one day making the machines available the rest of the week.
the program increases downtime and lessens the active machine availability as the production process is stopped twice a week for maintenance.
