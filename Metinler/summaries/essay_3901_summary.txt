after donal matthews left his place as an administrator for the department of surgery, wise medical center began to search for candidates for the vacant position.
after a preliminary selection process, four candidates remained to compete for the position david obrien, salvatore sorrentino, marcia rabin, and bonnie goldsmith.
salvatore sorrentino has worked in healthcare for six years, and most of his career, he worked as a division administrator for cardiology.
marcia rabin is definitely the most suitable candidate for that position.
rabin was majored in psychology but then applied to a masters program in healthcare management, so it is not clear whether her skills in economics are sufficient.
but in fact, rabins experience in top positions and her hard work are excellent qualities for adapting and mastering new skills.
slyter 2019 from rasmussen university claims that mentoring skills that create confidence and mutual trust are integral for every healthcare administrator.
marcia rabin is a priority candidate for this position because of her competence and experience in toplevel positions in healthcare.
