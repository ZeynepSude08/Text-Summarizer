science and integrity in frankenstein and dr.
jekyll, for example, finds frankensteins numerous scientific experiments and observations fascinating despite his abandonment.
another message that frankensteins abandoning of a scientific experiment sends is that the domains of science and integrity have distinct demarcations and bounds.
while both jekyll and hyde are enthused about their scientific research, frankenstein decides to abandon his project, calling it a bad idea.
the other two scientists jekyll and hyde are shown as selfcentered and egotistical, but frankenstein is regarded as a man of integrity who is true to his ideals and objectives.
most of the ethical rules and integrity that govern scientific study are broken by frankenstein and dr.
the utilization of human cadavers by frankenstein is also regarded as a complete breach of scientific integrity.
