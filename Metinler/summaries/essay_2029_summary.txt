to begin with, i created a picture inspired by the film persepolis which shows the life of an iranian girl in times of political control and repressions.
even though an art i created relates to the other type of medium, picture, not a film, it is still strongly connected to persepolis and has a similar meaning and the same palette of colors.
for the created art appendix a, as an inspiration was taken the film persepolis, which puts in the center of discussion the topic of authoritarian control and repression in iran.
in conclusion, as a film, persepolis tells the story of a girl coming of age in times of political repression and revolution, giving a viewer food for thoughts by colors and the main characters attitude towards her life in the city.
