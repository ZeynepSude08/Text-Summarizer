social class is perhaps one of the most prevalent forms of inequalities, especially in capitalist societies where resources are owned and controlled by a few.
this essay defines the various forms of stratification and addresses the issues of intersectionality and accessibility.
social class can be described as a classification of people possessing similar socioeconomic status.
according to manstead 2018, social class shares compatibility with the term subjective social rank, where material resources classify people as lower, middle or working, and upper class.
however, my own experience of intersectionality is the refusal to classify other people along any lines of stratification.
the argument is social class and socioeconomic status are better suited to describe access to resources.
the main forms of stratification have been discussed, including class, gender, race, and age.
as many people, including scholars, acknowledge the need for sensitivity, the subject of intersectionality is becoming more popular where people are encouraged to accept alternative forms of social hierarchies.
reallife examples of both intersectional and social stratification have been offered.
