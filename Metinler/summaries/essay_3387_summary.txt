this paper looks at vaccination of the population as an effective way to combat covid19 disease.
among the main positive factors in support of compulsory vaccination is the creation of collective immunity, which will help to reduce the incidence of the disease.
to better understand why it is necessary to vaccinate the worlds population against coronavirus infection, people can turn to history.
it is because many people in todays society are vaccinated against diseases such as polio or rubella that the level of deleterious effects of these organisms is virtually nil.
thus, when vaccinated, people are not carriers of the disease and cannot get sick or infect others.
the main effect of the covid19 vaccination is to transform the human immune system so that the body can recognize and target pathogens.
the state of a persons immune system, which can be characterized by the strength of their resistance to disease or the presence of chronic disease, play a significant role in the end result from vaccination.
literature shows that vaccination protects individuals from covid19 and reduces the risk of transmission of disease to others hayes and pollock 374.
vaccination is then one of the most effective ways to combat the disease, preventing its spread and creating a collective immunity tregoning et al.
however, it is the view that the imposition of compulsory vaccination impedes the personal boundaries of individuals that prevents immunization against disease.
this leads to a policy of safety and the importance of compulsory vaccination as an effective weapon against covid19.
on the other hand, despite the undeniable benefits of vaccination against covid19 in reducing the incidence and transmission of the virus, the issue of mandatory nature is still controversial.
therefore, once a person has been vaccinated, he or she will become resistant to the disease and its possible modifications and will be able to protect those around him or her from the disease.
