however, the process also produces significant carbon dioxide, which requires capturing and reuse.
in conclusion, the beer fermentation process involves the conversion of sugar into alcohol and co2 by yeast cells.
the released carbon dioxide gas can be reused with proper capturing within the beer manufacturing process itself.
