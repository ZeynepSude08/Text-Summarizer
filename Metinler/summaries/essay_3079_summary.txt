in working at the leo club, i had to establish contacts with many people and explain the work plan to students in detail.
high initiative, among my main qualities, allowed me to volunteer at the international language sabbath school, where i took care of the children, helped the teacher, and taught students certain words in arabic.
my experience of teaching children has helped me in teaching students at my club.
