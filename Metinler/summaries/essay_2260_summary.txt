generals of the american civil war ulysses grant and robert lee research paper
they made major contributions to the period as military commanders  lee leading the army of northern virginia and grant commanding various forces in the western theater and then the army of the potomac.
research indicates that lee was a better tactician, but grant superseded him in operational art and strategy alike and, hence, was superior to lee as a military leader.
generally speaking, grant and lee received different treatment in the annals of american history.
external political influences impacted the images of both generals  lees to the better and grants to the worse  and it is necessary to see through them.
the first logical step is to compare grant and lees grasp of tactics  that is, the ability to win a given battle.
12 hence, one may consider grant a more focused and goaloriented operator than lee.
as one can see, grant comes superior in his comparison to lee as a military leader.
finally, grant always kept the strategic picture in his mind and planned his actions accordingly, while lees choice in favor of the gettysburg campaign indicates his tendency to sacrifice strategic considerations for better operational prospects.
since strategic and operational mastery is ultimately more important in winning the war than tactical excellence, one may conclude that grant and not lee was the best general of the american civil war.
