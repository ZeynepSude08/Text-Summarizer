opv cells are perfectly suited to power mobile applications  camping gear, wearable technologies, or phone chargers naushad, rajendran,  alenizi, 2020.
1. light with high enough energy levels is absorbed by the osc and excites electrons from the homo to the lumo to form an exciton.
if the energy of the light being absorbed is greater than the band gap, the electron will move to a higher level agugliaro  garca, 2020.
if there is no current flowing through the opv cell, the voltage is called the opencircuit voltage voc and on a currentvoltage curve, this correlates to the xintercept.
