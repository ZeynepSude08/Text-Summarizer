the access servers communicate directly to the overall framework known as the radius server.
a client is granted an entry if the radius provides an okay by communicating to the access server, which then responds by authenticating the tunnels in use.
the servers in use create a unique message referred to as access request and send it to the central database to validate the key structure previously created in the form of username and password.
