everyone makes their own decision whether they need to give money to the homeless people or not.
on the one hand, money can help homeless people meet their basic needs.
when people meet a homeless person on the street and give him money or food, they make a mistake at best, it will help him, but only for a while at worst, people support his lifestyle.
sometimes homeless people do not need money, but human attention to their problem makes it easy to buy such a person food or help find a free overnight stay.
summing up, everyone should make their own decision about giving money to homeless people.
