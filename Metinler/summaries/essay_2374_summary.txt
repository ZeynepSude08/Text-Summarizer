the present work uses hookers book to correct the notion that real differences exist between racial accounts between mexican and african american scholars.
by covering the two scholars and others, hooker succeeds in showing that the perceived differences between racism as viewed by mexicans and african americans are erroneous.
using the example of douglass and vasconcelos, for instance, hooker insists that both mexicans and the african american scholars arguments target similar plights of racial minorities in the u.s. hooker juxtaposition vasconcelos cosmic race theory to douglasss account of ethnicitybased segregation in the u.s. as a way of showing the similarities between the racial versions of the two americas.
in vasconcelos work, the scholar provides latin americas mestizaje communities with a lasting solution to americas issues due to racism.
according to hooker, it is significantly impossible for mexican scholars to have the same thoughts about racism as african americans living in the u.s. due to their differences.
hooker provides real examples of how douglass, an african american scholar covering the issue of racism in the u.s., relates and informs vasconcelos, a twentiethcentury mexican scholar on racism.
