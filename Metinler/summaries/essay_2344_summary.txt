the main difference in health insurance coverage in new zealand is that diseases unrelated to an occupational injury are not covered by insurance.
an accident at work is an event resulting from which the insured has received an injury or other damage to health while performing duties under an employment contract.
returning to the topic of differentiation between the range of injuries resulting from an incident and damages resulting from an illness, the main difference also remains the different sizes of insurance.
by the policy of separation and by allocating more funds to support one group of people with disabilities, insurance companies cynically force people to fight and prove the severity of the light of the injury.
