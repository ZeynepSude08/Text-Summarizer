restricting immigration can be considered enforcing national laws moreover, such restrictions facilitate the greater integration of migrants.
president obamas decision at one time contradicted existing immigration laws, but the president had the authority to impose the passing of daca.
the process of migrating to the united states in violation of federal immigration laws is not explicitly caused by the daca program and its terms.
the migration problem poses a direct threat to the national security of the united states.
despite the predicted negative consequences of the abolition of daca, a preferable policy would be to suspend the program to ensure national security in fighting against violations of migration laws.
