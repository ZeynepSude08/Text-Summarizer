excess postexercise oxygen consumption epoc is a state in which a person intakes an increased amount of oxygen as a consequence of active exercise.
the epoc occurs during the recovery after the steady state of the exercise.
oxygen deficit occurs during the early stages of exercise when the consumption of oxygen by the body exceeds its intake.
oxygen deficit also continues during the steady state and is stabilized during recovery.
oxygen deficit occurs from the beginning of the exercises to the 13minute mark.
