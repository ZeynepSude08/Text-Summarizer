however, there is a lack of native american restaurants despite the fact that this culture directly correlates with the territory of the current us.
several reasons have impacted this gap, especially the historical background, the poverty that affects the native american community, and the different approaches to food as a whole.
due to the extended efforts towards westernizing native americans, many aspects of the culture that have been descriptive of the community became much less practiced or even remembered.
native americans have had a tragic history involving colonists, diseases, targeted extermination, abuse, and cultural assimilation aimed to mitigate traditions, languages, and historic differences contrasting with the colonists ways of life.
due to the lack of connection, opening a traditional native american restaurant for people not used to such foods may appear to be a doomed idea.
a lack of native american restaurants can be one illustration of the authorities being passive towards encouraging the communities to open businesses.
moreover, the current poverty that is prevalent in reservations does not allow native americans to follow the tradition of their ancestors, which leads to a change in the practice of growing food and continuing the habits of hunting and agriculture.
the modern agricultural industry is different from the more sustainable and natural ways of obtaining food, which is another cause for the decrease in popularity of native american cuisine.
