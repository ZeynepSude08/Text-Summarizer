the primary organ affected by asthma is the lungs, as the disease is caused by airway narrowing and the inability to breathe.
hence, one of the major changes in the airway caused by asthma is bronchoconstriction.
another physiological manifestation of asthma is airway edema.
hence, taking into consideration the pathophysiology of asthma, it can be concluded that the general pattern of the disease is characterized by the airway limitation and lung pressure that happens as a result of exposure to an irritant or stimulus.
