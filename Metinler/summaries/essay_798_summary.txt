the doughnut economics book by kate raworth essay
in her book doughnut economics , kate raworth discusses the main aspects of the modern economy, the challenges of economic growth, and changes to be promoted in society.
therefore, i wanted to continue reading the section and find out raworths attitude toward economics that allowed her to create the doughnut concept.
i believe that, instead of supporting the readers in their choices to study economics, raworth 2017 deliberately underlines that it is high time to reveal confusing old ideas and replace them with new ones for inspiration.
