however, while the child tends to perceive the surroundings through the lens of various institutions, including immediate family, educators, peers, and social environment in general, it is the impact of the nuclear family that has a longterm effect on childrens cognitive development.
1. thus, the advocacy challenge for the present action plan is the promotion of holistic child development in children adopted by lgbtq families.
in order to handle this risk of developing severe identity issues, social connections and the narrative of family relations should be defined through close interaction between parents, children, and early childhood educators.
indeed, children are exposed to social pressure from children or educators on the matter of their parents or, if disclosed, their adoption.
hence, as far as the ideals of naeyc 2011 code of ethical conduct are concerned, the primary ideal to address is the statement i1.2, which claims that the qualifications of an educator should include the information on childs social development and the means of proper communication with their parents.
using this ideal, educators can develop a framework that helps both parents and children work in psychologically safe ways to communicate with little children on such important social topics as adoption, stigma, and gender and sexual diversity.
when educators are aware of the means to communicate complex messages to children, they can assist parents and monitor the peer environment in the learning establishment.
the primary stakeholders of the proposed action plan to promote meaningful communication between lgbtq parents and their adopted children include parents, children, child educators, and social organizations.
for the creation of the plan, it is necessary to promote the collaboration between the ngos, educators, and social initiatives that support the rhetoric of equality of eliminating stigma from the lgbtq community and adopted children.
