one such wearable device is a smartwatch  a portable gadget intended to be worn on a wrist and aimed to record heart rate and other vital signs.
these and other smartwatch functions make it a practical and useful device for many people.
to solve this problem, the producers of wearable devices recommend disabling some apps, dimming the brightness on the smartwatch, and switching off bluetooth.
in such a way, healthcare providers may use the information from smartwatches to track patients health and prevent diseases.
if a patient complains of health problems, a healthcare provider will look through the data they receive from the smartwatch to an app and see whether a patient has deprivation of sleep, heart rate changes, or other issues.
i think that smartwatches are useful and helpful devices that make our lives more comfortable.
i agree with this assumption because i think that if one of the main functions of smartwatches is to monitor ones heart rate and sleep length, people will need to wear them constantly to receive proper reports.
those who feel uncomfortable with a small size of a smartwatch should think of different devices to monitor their activities and health.
the smartwatch industry is constantly growing and changing, and it will continue to succeed in the future until there is a demand for these wearable devices.
moreover, if all smartwatches have a function of health monitoring and the possibility to send this information to healthcare providers, more and more people will want to wear them.
