i would like to specialize as a family nurse practitioner fnp and an infection control nurse icn.
i will also need to obtain a license and work as a registered nurse to become familiar with a wide range of nursing techniques before applying for the chosen masters program.
according to johnson  johnsons recommendations, a masters in science of nursing program is needed for family nursing work to provide me with a deeper understanding of the theoretical application of family nursing.
if i choose to earn my adn or bsn, my whole academic path to get specialized as an infection control nurse can take up to four years.
first of all, i need to get a bachelor of science in nursing bsn, and then pass the nclexrn and work as a registered nurse.
then i plan to work as a registered nurse as work experience is required for further education.
when i become a family health nurse or an infection control nurse, my main goal will be to maintain professional ethics and maximize patient care.
