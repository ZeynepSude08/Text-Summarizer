age factor in drug therapy for cardiovascular patient case study
the patient from the assigned case has a history of a heart attack at the age of 54.
as a result, the patients age might be affecting the current medication plan.
pharmacodynamics the patient from the assigned case has hypertension, which could result from age affecting their blood vessels.
therefore, it would be reasonable to lower the total number of medications so that an elderly patient could take only the drugs necessary for their condition.
the dosage of certain medicines can be reduced as well in order to avoid unnecessary accumulation in the patients body and ease the drugs excretion.
the recommended drug therapy for the patient from the assigned case consists of the following medications
moreover, negative drugtodrug interactions can occur between the medications from the list  for instance, aspirin can potentially nullify the benefits of lisinopril drug interactions between aspir 81 and lisinopril, n.d..
based on examples from the previous section and effects of age on drugs pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, it seems appropriate to make the following changes to medication regimen
the patient from the assigned case fits all three groups however, due to possible adverse interactions with lisinopril, aspirin should be taken in a minimal therapeutic dosage
at the same time, it mitigates the risks of polypharmacy and excessive drug accumulation caused by pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics usual for elderly patients.
