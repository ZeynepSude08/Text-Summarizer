i did not reach my estimate despite having a good level of food intake because of insufficient physical activity and exercise, which are usually the most effective methods of increasing the daily expenditure.
some of the areas in my diet need to be improved to include more nutrientdense foods.
i need to improve the amount of protein and dietary fiber i consume by adding peas, lentils, chickpeas, and beans to my diet.
i also need to choose healthy eating habits, including keeping my food portion at a reasonable size to ensure my daily calorie intake is reduced.
