metaphons phase 1 is the most critical phase and the one that most distinguishes it from other published phonological therapy programs.
the objective is to pique the childs interest in the phonology of the adult target language, to educate the child about the properties of sounds and their contrastive nature, to demonstrate that contrasts between sounds convey meaning, and to help the child realize that these features can be manipulated to increase the likelihood of being understood.
phonological disorders are characterized by predictable, rulebased abnormalities that influence several sounds e.g., fronting, halting, and final consonant deletion.
because it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between articulation and phonological abnormalities, many academics and clinicians prefer to refer to speech mistakes of unclear origin as speech sound disorder.
