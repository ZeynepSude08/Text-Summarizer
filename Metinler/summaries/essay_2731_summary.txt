the cultural misappropriation of the cleveland indians essay
the cultural misappropriation of the cleveland indians, an american ball club, has been a practice that has continued for a long time because of the unresolved contention encompassing its logo and name.
the essay discusses the controversy over the cleveland indians name and how the issue was resolved.
the group received national attention in its early years as it wrangled with the indians board of directors about whether the logo of chief wahoo would still be in use once the team moved to their new arena.
the 1997 allstar game also featured fights, which were in attendance by louis sockalexis relative, the local american player for whom the cleveland team was said to be named after.
after many years of backlash from native american groups and fans, the cleveland indians decided to change their name, thus separating themselves from a term that has often been branded as discriminatory for some time.
indeed this, on its way, was solving the cultural misappropriation of the cleveland indians.
since roughly 1915, the cleveland indians have been identified as the indians, but american native groups and others have long opposed the iconography of sports teams, mascots, and indigenous names because they were claimed intolerant and demeaning.
