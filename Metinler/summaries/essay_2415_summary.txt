the stark law codified in the united states code, title 42, section 1395nn , prohibits physicians to refer medicaid or medicare patients to an entity for certain healthcare services if the physicians have a financial relationship with the entity.
clinical ethical issues encourage personal, humane, compassionate, and fair interactions between doctor and patient.
