america through the prism of barlows original vision and british opinions essay
within threefour decades, british authors like charles dickens, alexis de tocqueville, and anthony trollope questioned its social freedoms and public affairs.
barlows original vision of the united states as a young and promising country and observations developed by dickens, tocqueville, and trollope introduce a new twoway analysis of american democracy, social order, and economic stability.
democracy was evident in the country, but it did not motivate but made everything available, meaning americans should not work hard to invent something new but use available resources.
human relationships defined americans in many ways in the 1800s, and the chosen authors demonstrated their visions about how social order had to be promoted.
at the same time, despite evident differences in opinions about public relationships, the original position developed by barlow and the vision of america by tocqueville, trollope, and dickens had some things in common.
dickens, tocqueville, and trollope also believed that the way how americans earned money could become a good example for their countries.
barlows original vision of america as a young and ambitious country and an experienced combination of thoughts developed by dickens, tocqueville, and trollope with time had many similar and diverse characteristics.
