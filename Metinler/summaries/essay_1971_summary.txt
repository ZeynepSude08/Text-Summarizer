acute lymphoblastic leukemia causes, origin, and gene mutation essay
chromosome analysis is crucial to determine whether a patient has acute lymphoblastic leukemia and, if so, which subtype is based on the identified chromosome changes.
apart from analyzing chromosome abnormalities present in patients with all, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the disorders origin, including primary causes and the process of gene mutations.
in regards to the causes of all, the disorder occurs when there are genetic mutations in a bone marrow cell.
acute lymphoblastic leukemia is caused by cells dividing at a rate that interferes with the normal process of blood cell production.
as a result of these abnormalities in cell proliferation, the bone marrow makes cells not mature enough to function properly, leading to them becoming lymphoblasts, which are essentially white blood cells mutated to cause leukemia.
this process ensures there is substantial information about existing risk factors that might have led to the child developing the disorder, including radiation and cancercausing chemicals exposure, genetic syndromes, and so on.
