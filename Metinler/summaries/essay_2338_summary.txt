although impressive opportunities provided by the internet imply better access to education, many students still struggle to do their homework due to a lack of broadband.
on the local level, small telecom providers should work as change agents to convince businesses that their efforts would improve students access to education.
the digital divide in education is a problem that places some students in a disadvantaged position, when their chances to do homework and learn effectively are limited.
therefore, there is a need to not only promote digital education but also make sure that students are equipped with broadband.
