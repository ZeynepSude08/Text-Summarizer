charita chalmers, a supervisory employee at the tulon company in richmond, was terminated after sending several letters to other employees houses, targeting their religious beliefs and life choices.
lamantia was working at a different branch that day, his wife opened the letter and assumed that chalmers was talking about an affair mr.
the employer could not have known that chalmers was planning on sending the letters or predicted their contents.
furthermore, if the employee proceeded to send the distressing letters, without following the direct orders from the employer, it would be within the employers rights to terminate her.
lamartia, who is also an employee of tulon, expresses his discontent with the situation and with chalmers, then the incident becomes more complicated.
