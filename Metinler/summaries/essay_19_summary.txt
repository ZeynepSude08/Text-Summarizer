the plan supports retirement savings primarily in two forms regular contributions to a company plan or dc 401k plan and by government or nonprofit organizations  referred to as 403b or 457b u.s. department of labor.
to maintain the 401k income reduction tax benefit, the law provides that, unless an exemption applies, money must be held in a tax reduction plan or equivalent plan until the employee reaches age.
the ability to carry forward income taxes to a period when tax rates may be lower is a potential benefit of a 401k plan.
this ability to avoid this second level of tax is a major benefit of the 401k plan.
compared to investing outside of 401k plans, one pays more income tax, but one pays less tax overall with a 401k due to the ability to avoid taxes on capital gains.
i am planning to earn 50,000 in a year and save 3,000 in a 401k account that year reports only 47,000 of income on the annual tax return.
