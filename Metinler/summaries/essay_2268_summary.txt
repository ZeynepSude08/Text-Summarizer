when analyzing the difference between boeing and airbus, in america, both manufacturers offer products in the same categories, comprising uncrewed aircraft, commercial aircraft, space systems, and military aircraft airbus is differentiated by civilian helicopter quantity duddu, 2020.
however, airbus is also benefiting from the state support given to boeing by the u.s. government and federal states since the benefits have enabled airbus to generate revenue of 17.5 percent in north america.
the state benefits enjoyed by boeing in the u.s. will always increase its output by more than it increases the production of airbus, and with this, the aircraft industrys output will always rise.
each organization acts based on the assumption that its rival will never alter its production and, therefore, chooses to maximize its profit based on its output trisha, n.d. by assuming boeing a is the first to produce and sell air crafts, its production quantity will be a and its price p, with the profits set at a maximum since mcmr0.
it becomes clear that firm airbus will produce half of what a.d. grows since, based on cournots assumption of rivals fixed output, level output at a.b.s, of price f, profit, and revenue will be maximum trisha, n.d. airbus will therefore produce half of what boeing makes and will not have supplied to the market.
so, it will produce onehalf of the market that airbus has not supplied trisha, n.d. with airbus covering onequarter of the market, boeing will be forced to make threeeighths of the entire market in the next period.
