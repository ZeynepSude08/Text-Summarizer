when faced with a different cultural reality, migrants are often at odds with the traditions of the new world and seek to preserve what is called their national identity.
often, individuals from the same country of origin form diasporas, to accommodate their cultural traditions and seek companionship among people of their kind rather than become fully immersed and assimilated.
lahiris story reflects an individual who grew up fully immersed in his indian culture, before being sent to study in the uk, and later found work in the us.
his connections with the vietnamese culture, however, seem lacking, as most of the traditions are upheld only by his mother.
lahiri treats foreign culture with polite deference, while lam attempts to adopt it as his own, even engaging in individualistic practices and achievements that are valued in the west, over the collectivistspiritualist culture of his vietnamese mother.
lan presents the different facets of cultural assimilation, being at a strange point where he manages to function well in a foreign society and even internalize some of its core tenets while failing to fully embrace his new identity.
while lahiri can potentially seek refuge in diasporas and nationalism, lan does not seem to have an option besides fully immersing himself in american culture, or returning to vietnamese roots.
