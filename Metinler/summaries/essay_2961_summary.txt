4. application of nmr in mof analysis
with the advancement of solidstate physics concepts and studies, nmr spectroscopy is expected to find more applications in analytical and organic chemistries.
mofs are increasingly being studied using solidstate nmr spectroscopy to discover nmractive nuclei in their framework.
the most common applications of nmr spectroscopy are in medicine, analytical chemistry, and the food sector.
mofs analysis through nmr spectroscopy enables scientists to understand a substances structure without inferring with the sample.
