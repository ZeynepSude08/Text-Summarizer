spark is an opensource cluster of computer frameworks that optimally process realtime data.
in this case, organizations use the spark system since it efficiently compiles realtime data and relays optimal analysis.
the key difference between hadoop and spark is the approach to the data analytics process.
apache spark processes data one hundred times faster than the hadoop mapreduce tool, thus increasing the data analytics mainframe dayananda, 2020.
i would recommend that the ceo approves the use of both hadoop and spark due to the optimal efficiency and scalability provided across different fields of operations.
while hadoop focuses on a batch of databases collected over a period of time, spark optimizes on the realtime dataset.
ideally, spark and hadoop complement each other under the spectral view of dynamism in data analysis on realtime and batch datasets.
