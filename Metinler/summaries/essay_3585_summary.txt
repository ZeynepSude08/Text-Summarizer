ruby bridges movie is based on the true story of ruby nell bridges, a sixyearold new orleans child who became the first africanamerican student in the citys public schools in 1960.
ruby was the sole black student at the school to which she was sent in fact, she was the only student at the institution in question.
ruby bridges is a wonderful family film that is both historically accurate and touching.
in conclusion, one of the reasons i enjoyed this film was how it depicted the impact rubys admission to the school had on her family.
