the problem of machines replacing human labor is vital not only in our perception of the present, where robots and artificial intelligence are gradually replacing humans.
robots are able to perform basic work at a high level due to a number of skills to be implemented as a part of their programs.
at the moment, it is claimed that more than 1.5 million rudimentary work tasks have been replaced with automated process execution by robots casey and nzau.
modern reality implies certain flexibility of human labor skills however, not everyone, being tied to their work, may be able to adapt to the coming robotic revolution.
the loss of more unnecessary work positions does not necessarily mean that new jobs requiring new skills will not appear because of ongoing automation.
however, the work related to the maintenance of robotics and monitoring of machines still requires human control.
new jobs will be added to provide a person with greater comfort since the work performed in a new, robotic world requires more mental than physical activity.
