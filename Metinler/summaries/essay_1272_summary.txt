the lack of knowledge about the laws of heredity, the genetic and ecological structure of species, and the lack of experimental evidence of natural selection served as the basis for the growth of critical attitudes towards darwinism.
finding and studying fossils of transitional forms makes it possible to compile paleontological evolutionary series of organisms.
speciation is the process of species formation carried out due to the interaction of elementary evolutionary factors mutations, gene drift, natural selection, waves of life, and isolation.
natural selection is an evolutionary process in which individuals with traits conducive to survival reproduce faster.
i think darwin did a lot of work and got a specific database and evidence that natural selection and evolution of species exist.
the main achievement of darwin, which has retained its significance to the present time, is the description of natural selection as a mechanism that ensures the fitness of organisms to the environment and their morphological diversity.
for the evasive forms to give rise to new species, the exchange of genes between them must stop that is, in one way or another, isolation conditions must develop that prevent crossing.
the modern theory of natural selection, which allows us to find those parts of the genome on which natural selection acted and use this knowledge to create new plant varieties and animal breeds, preserves the darwinian approach to explaining the fitness of organisms in the environment.
