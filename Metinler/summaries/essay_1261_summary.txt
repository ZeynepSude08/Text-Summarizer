epigenetics refers to the study of how cells regulate gene functions and activities without altering the essential sequence of dna hanson  hotaling, 2020.
the documentary shows that epigenetic variations mark as consistent and natural happening but can be impacted by other elements such as environment, age, disease state, and lifestyle.
through this process, the cell adjustments can result in more harmful ramifications, such as the commencement of diseases like cancer and even other conditions such as obesity hanson  hotaling, 2020.
while several differences exist among the diseases identified in the family members, the history marks a critical risk factor for various conditions, as seen in the commencement of illnesses among the family.
reflecting on the model of epigenetics, it is clear that every member of my family inherited some genes, encompassing socioeconomic and cultural experiences that positioned them at danger of some of these diseases.
based on the completed family history assessment, i would not wholly link my risk metric to the outcome of the investigation and infer that i am vulnerable to the aboveidentified conditions.
my overall life expectancy score could be impacted by family history, demographic factors, lifestyle, or environmental factors.
accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in normal cells and cancer risk.
