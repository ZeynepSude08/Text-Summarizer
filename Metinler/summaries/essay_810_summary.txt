this essay will explore some key moments from videos, an article, and a film that features the theme of ethics in genetic engineering and define arguments against genetic modifications.
next, another video on crispr technology suggests that genetic modification has been one of sciences priorities since the discovery of dna.
therefore, even though the crispr technology sufficiently improved the time and cost of genetic modification operations, external regulating commissions should thoroughly examine the experiments and their potential consequences.
therefore, while genetic modification could be used to eliminate deficiencies such as hereditary diseases, genetic engineering should not be used in humans because of potential threats to the population and ethical concerns.
