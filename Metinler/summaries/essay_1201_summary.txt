diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of naegleria fowleri disease case study
a little volume of csf is taken and submitted to a lab to be checked under magnification for the presence of the naegleria amoeba.
following surgery, the csf was unclear, with higher pressure 300 mmhg, an acceptable pandys examination, relatively reduced sugar 1 mmoll, significantly higher leukocytes 1,170 cellsmm3 plus 83 percent neutrophils, and peptide 300 mgdl.
the patient was immediately put on a regimen of venous conventional amphotericin b 5 mg at first, then on the following day, 10mg is administered.
even though his vital signs became reasonably constant with average body temperature, heart rate, and pressure after five days of goal therapies, a revisit csf investigation for trophozoites was negligible.
