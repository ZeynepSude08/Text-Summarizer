in the equations above, f represents the force exerted, k is the spring constant given in nm, and x is the extension or compression given by the difference between the new and original lengths of the material.
to experimentally determine the relationship between the force exerted on a spring and the extension or compression produced
a verticallyhanging spring  different masses
different elastic materials have different spring constants, implying that they react differently to forces exerted on them.
the three main elements studied in this experiment are mass, force, spring constant, and extension.
from the above equation, the spring constant can be derived from the equation for force.
in the first two trials, different masses were used to show the variation between mass and extension.
hookes law is one of the fundamental principles in physics that defines the relationship between mass exerted and the extensioncompression of an elastic material.
the graph shows a linear relationship between mass and extension, with its slope giving the springs constant.
