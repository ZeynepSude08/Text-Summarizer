while marvel has advantages with large character casts, relatability, and popularity, they are overshadowed assets of dc heroes.
dc characters are still generally more interesting and have greater depth, possibly due to dc having characters that were regular humans but still superheroes before marvel, with batman rising in popularity sooner than ironman.
dc presents much more success in cases of legacy characters than marvel.
the reason that marvel and dc remain fierce competitors, is related to the fact that both provide a number of advantages in terms of characters.
while marvel hosts a large number of relatable characters, they lack the exact thoughtfulness and depth that is more commonly seen in the few but welldeveloped dc heroes.
