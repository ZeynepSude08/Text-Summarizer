the term caring exhibits different meanings among different people in the world.
on the other hand, the term loving exhibits equally diverse definitions and meanings among different people.
many people, for instance, understand the word loving as depicting great care towards someone or something.
basing the meaning of the term loving on feelings, for example, implies that the word lacks meaning the moment the feelings, which are mainly chemical reactions, cease.
that is why a friend of mine defines the term loving as agape, or the unconditional divine love towards people, creatures, and things.
the terms mother and wife, too, have varied meanings to different people, especially today.
