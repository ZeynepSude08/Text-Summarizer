the opening of the poem american sonnet for my past and future assassin contradicts the central message of how the poet feels and the conflict of being a black american.
the oppression of black americans and racism have been deeply explored in both poems.
through the poem why are you bugging me, you stank minuscule husk, hayes shows the black mans oppression and need to deliberate him from the assassin.
