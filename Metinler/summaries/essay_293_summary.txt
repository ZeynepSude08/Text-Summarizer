simple squamous epithelium represents a single layer of flat cells that have the shape of scales.
because simple squamous epithelium is involved in the composition of the lungs, the heart, blood, and lymphatic vessels, it plays crucial functions in the body.
the blood and lymphatic vessels also play vital roles in the human organism, with simple squamous epithelium representing their core component.
the image of the simple squamous epithelium is represented in the longitudinal section, which is done by achieving a plane along the long axis of the structure.
therefore, the tissue cut in the long direction, the longitudinal section of the simple epithelium will mean that the image should show that every cell touches the basement membrane.
