the authors examine phonetics in a small arab population that speaks english as their second language because arabic has different dialects across people, which can help understand how each dialect realizes stress words in english.
the first subgroups involve stress realization among different arabic dialects, while the second group compares the word stress between native english speakers and arabic english speakers.
the authors use a qualitative approach in collecting and analyzing data that answers whether different arabic dialects affect stress realization on particular words.
consequently, the authors also use the analyzed data to identify stress words between arabic and native english speakers to understand the most stressed sounds in a word or phrase among people using english as their second language.
the authors analyze data through auditing read speech qualitatively in both subgroups and comparing the differences in stress on specific words.
on the other hand, there was a significant difference in the word stress between native english speakers and arabic english speakers, confirming that communities using english as a second have distinct word stress during communication.
in this paper, the authors explore differences in rhymes, tones, stress, and intonation between two arabic dialects, lebanese and egyptian arabic.
