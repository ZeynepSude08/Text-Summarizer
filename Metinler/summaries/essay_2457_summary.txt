examining the ways of using the missional theory in encouraging compliance with the principles of the new testament church, one should focus closer on the values and ideas that the aid new testament church invites.
however, the introduction of the missionary strategy into the new testament church will also help to place the trinitary position at the forefront, encouraging christians to return to the traditional christian values, while simultaneously embracing change.
namely, with the incorporation of the suggested framework of the missional theory and the creation of the new testament church, one will address the problem of change that has been in existence in the christian context for centuries.
therefore, as a leader of the new testament church, one will need the missional framework as the tool for uniting community members and reminding them of the shared values while performing change.
by allowing one to reinterpret the traditional notion and perception of sin in the old testament as the cause of the fall of a human being into its more sympathetic reiteration of the new testament, the missional theology encourages one to promote christian values not only within the community but also globally.
with the focus on spreading the principles of christianity on the worldwide level, the missional theory creates perfect premises for furthering the agenda of the new testament church.
