indian culture is more highcontext than american culture, so the outsourced employees use indirect communication to preserve face and do not openly criticize the manager.
acknowledging cultural differences is important so the workplace misunderstandings that are spoofed in outsourced can be avoided.
a comprehensive approach that includes training, tailored sessions, individual coaching, cultural outings, and regular diagnostic assessments is required to develop intercultural competence.
secondly, intercultural competence reduces ethnocentrism, the tendency to judge the customs of another culture by the standards of your own.
since it varies by culture, intercultural competence would enable employees to adapt to different systems.
