the chornobyl nuclear accident, which happened in 1986, was one of the most devastating ecological events that changed the fates of thousands of people in many countries.
i have also read somewhere that the thenruling government of the ussr kept the explosion a secret, which prevented people from saving their lives within the first few hours and days after the accident.
that is why i want to investigate the topic of the chornobyl nuclear accident.
