this essay demonstrates that biosolids are safe, beneficial to the environment, and essential for enhancing the soil structure while providing a better alternative to inorganic fertilizers.
according to chow and pan 2020, biosolids are essential in the agricultural sector due to their role in adding and replenishing lost soil nutrients, improving soil structure.
in some cases, crops die even in heavy rains because soils lose up to 50  of water through evapotranspiration, a challenge that can be mitigated by application of biosolids in drylands barbarick et al., 2017.
2018 biosolids long termeffect on soil quality and productivity revealed that they can be used in agricultural lands for many years without negative effects on the soil.
with the continued use of biosolids, soil fertility is increased, translating to high crop yields ippolito et al., 2021.
since they are low on metallic compounds, biosolids provide an effective means of enhancing soil quality for sustainable agriculture.
in comparison to chemical fertilizers, biosolids do not harm the soil quality when applied continuously for many years.
longterm effects of biosolids on soil quality and fertility.
