while everybody is vaguely aware that climate change is a major problem, few americans have actually bothered to research this issue thoroughly themselves beyond reading a few headlines.
my target audience for this research paper is the youth because we are the ones who will feel the burden of climate change within our lifetimes.
the aim of this research is to help both me and my readers understand the topic of climate change from an academic viewpoint, rather than getting a filtered version from mass media and politicians.
on december 7th, i will finally hand in my paper that effectively synthesizes current academic scholarship on climate change for the youth that will hopefully galvanize them into action.
