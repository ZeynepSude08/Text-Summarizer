whittaker hypothesized that there are at least two equivalent predictors that may cause female juncos to choose males to mate with.
the presence and content of 2pentadecanone in the male may be related to the saturation of particular odors that excite the reproductive call of female birds whittaker 70.
whittaker decided to test her hypotheses through observation the woman collected 22 male junko birds and measured the average percentage of white feathers.
on the row of the data table, each id had its measure of the number of chicks per mating period, the white feather content of that bird, and the substance content of the fatlike secretion.
do the percentage of 2pentadecanone in the fatlike secretion and the number of white feathers in male juncos affect their attractiveness among females during the mating period?
