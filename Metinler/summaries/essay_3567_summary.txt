voluntary consent becomes an ethical issue in cases when a person is deprived of full control and body autonomy and is subject to sexual assault.
moreover, a person cannot participate in sexual intercourse in case of a disease or disorder that restricts the ability to give or express consent to sex.
voluntary deception of the partner to induce sex might also be considered a sexual assault since the partner could not get trustworthy information to give voluntary informed consent.
