the creation of the black lives matter movement, unstable communitypolice relationships, and the inability to manage racial discrimination prove that american people need more changes at different organizational levels.
racism includes social and economic inequalities due to racial identity and is represented through dispossession, colonialism, and slavery in the past and lynching, criminalization, and incarceration in the present.
this paper aims to explore how racial capitalism, which originated in europe, penetrates americans and affects black lives.
racial capitalism is not just police or social inequality and injustice but a number of positive and negative interpersonal relationships determined by slavery, violence, and wars.
the concept of racial capitalism is relatively new in american society.
thus, racial capitalism is not an outcome or a solution for americans but a sentence according to which millions of people have to live.
yet, the spread of racial capitalism proves that many additional aspects may affect society.
another form of racial capitalism that could not be ignored in the 18 th and 19 th centuries was colonialism.
not many people are ready to talk about their problems out loud, and all those killings, rapes, shortages, and antiracial initiatives prove that racism exists in the united states and is nourished by european capitalism, increasing the impact of social injustice, racial inequality, and human violence.
