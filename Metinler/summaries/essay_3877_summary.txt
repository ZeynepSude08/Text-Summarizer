whitman, hughes, and the american dream essay
walt whitman and langston hughes, two prominent figures of american poetry of the past, are of them.
i hear america singing, i, too, harlem, and the negro speaks of rivers are the emotional responses to the american dream and societal processes relevant to those times.
this work examines four poems, one by whitman and three by hughes.
whitman speaks for those already socially accepted to belong to the american dream, and hughes represents the black community that wants to be a part of it.
