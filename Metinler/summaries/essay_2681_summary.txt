teaching experience diabetes prevention essay
the present essay describes the experience of teaching people how to prevent diabetes and identifies its strong sides and areas for improvement.
this teaching targets members of the punjabis sikh society who are at risk of developing diabetes.
finally, the nurse familiarizes the members of the educational group with the straightforward algorithm of actions for the cases when a patient realizes that he or she has symptoms of diabetes.
apart from the oral presentation, the nurse distributes booklets with information on the topic, a list of preventive measures, and an action plan for those who found acute symptoms of type 2 diabetes.
the target audience of the teaching is the adult population of punjabis sikhs because, in this community, the situation with diabetes is also adverse.
this way, the assistance of licensed nursing students in spreading information on diabetes among the adult members of the punjabis sikh community and educating punjabis sikhs is immensely precious.
more precisely, out of five adults who attended the lecture, three were diagnosed with the early stage of diabetes, and two are at high risk of developing this disease in the nearest future.
as it has already been mentioned above, three out of five participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within the framework of the teaching.
if the teaching consisted of the presentation exclusively, the probability that the participants would attend a hospital to check the blood for diabetes was low.
