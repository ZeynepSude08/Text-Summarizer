although because i could not stop for death by dickinson and the raven by poe were written decades apart, both use poetic devices in an enchanting manner to illustrate the concept of death and eternity.
in because i could not stop for death, dickinson uses symbolism to symbolize the human development from a child to an adult through the use of grains in the field and children at recess.
identically, in the raven, the raven represents the narrators grief following the death of his love lenore.
dickinson and poe both use alliteration in their poems to create rhythm.
on the other hand, because i could not stop for death has only six stanzas, each containing four lines, and even though the poem has internal and external rhymes, its rhyme scheme is also not as regular and strict as that of the raven.
the analysis of these two poems has shown that the choice of selected devices and their magnitude of use differ from one poet to another, but themes such as death and grief are universal.
