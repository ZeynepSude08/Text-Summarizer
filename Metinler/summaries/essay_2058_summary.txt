when the norm is rigid and uniform in its behavioral patterns and their variations alike, the members of other social, ethnic and cultural groups are perceived as outliers, decreasing the representative value of a study.
modern social and psychological researchers are polarized and challenged by the wide popularity of standardized assessment methods and frameworks in the studies that involve minority groups.
the systemic differences of study results between different ethnic groups tend to emerge throughout the modern research body, often with little to no dependence on the field itself.
since the presence of bias in research with diverse groups is a one of the topical scientific issues, it is fair to assume that the majority of researchers are somewhat familiar with it.
however, particularly when a research lies within the psychological field, ethical implications and considerations arise when interviewing a diverse group of respondents.
particularly when the study involves intergroup interaction, a researcher must be prepared to mediate potential conflicts between members of different groups of participants.
furthermore, when working with a diverse group it is a researchers responsibility to prevent and, if necessary, address the biases presented in the research questions.
thus, although scientific accuracy is required for any research, if a scientist is working with a diverse group they are ethically obliged to check the questions and exercises for potentially marginalizing implications.
in particular, tests that measure an individuals performance against the group average are referred to as normreferenced assessments.
