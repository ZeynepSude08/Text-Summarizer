the research in question was conducted for the purpose of finding out whether cognitive dysfunctions create poor participation in heart failure treatment.
based on the findings, researchers came to the conclusion that cognitive functions are linked to participation in heart failure treatment.
the research question is whether cognitive dysfunctions are associated with lower participation in outpatient treatment in patients with heart failure.
while the authors provide several references, there is not enough data on cognitive functions as a direct correlation to nonparticipation or participation in heart failure treatment.
thus, nurses can apply the studys findings in practice when determining individuals who need extra assistance in following the instructions that align with heart failure treatment measures.
