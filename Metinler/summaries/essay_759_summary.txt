unlike other characters such as sang, ed, nina, and beth, who are positively living the american dream to some point, jane is struggling to begin the success journey.
in other words, jane never experienced the american dream or the life she expected after graduating.
a few characters, including sang, devon, and janes grandfather, are living the american dream or are on the right path to achieving it.
janes grandfather also is illustrated to have lived the american dream.
the main difference is that jane had a chance to live her dreams in new york than in seoul.
in new york, jane was realizing her abilities and interests and living a better life on her terms compared to when in seoul.
when she is in new york, jane is more focused on achieving success no matter which job, even when it is not her dream job.
janes life conditions, especially economic, political, and social factors, make it difficult for her to live the american dream.
