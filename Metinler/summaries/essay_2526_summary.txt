however, the inability to control the stressor can reduce the prefrontal cortexs capacity to regulate stress responses.
exposure to stress escalates firing in the locus coeruleus leading to increased release of norepinephrine.
exposure to stress noticeably weakens the effectiveness of the prefrontal cortex while stimulating more primitive responses of the amygdala and rapid firing of noradrenergic.
acute stress weakens the prefrontal cortex functions on the working memory.
increased dopamine levels stimulate d1 receptors present in the prefrontal cortex impairing working memory.
norepinephrine is released under stressful conditions, and its levels dictate the molecular switch, which determines whether the prefrontal cortex is engaged or impaired.
