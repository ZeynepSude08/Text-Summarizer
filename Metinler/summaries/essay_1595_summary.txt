when working with patients, it is necessary to inform them about the risks of cardiovascular diseases and the development of metabolic syndrome.
as a preventive measure, especially if the patient already has risk factors, i recommend reviewing the daily diet by minimizing saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol.
as a physician, i must educate patients about the risks associated with the problem and help them change their habits to improve their health.
