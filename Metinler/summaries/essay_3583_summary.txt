the works by william blake and john keats, one of the best representatives of the romantic era, differ from the victorian poems written by edgar allan poe and matthew arnold.
although victorian poetry tried to diminish the place of such romantic characteristics as the faith in the human imagination, focus on emotions, and the reevaluation of nature, these values were not completely rejected.
arnold and poe are the representatives of victorian poetry who discuss the role of nature, emotions, and imagination under new industrial conditions.
therefore, relying on the poems by poe, arnold, keats, or blake, it is correct to say that there was a dignified place for romantic values in victorian poetry.
