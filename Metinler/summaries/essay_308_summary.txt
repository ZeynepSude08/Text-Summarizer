to start with two types of growth theories, one can distinguish two types of economic factors exogenous and endogenous.
they can be compared with exogenous and endogenous growth theories.
while exogenous factors are external and describe the resources of the economic system, endogenous ones show the quality of the economic systems agents.
neoclassical growth theories are examples of exogenous ones they are focused on exogenous factors, such as production rates, demand and supply amounts, and the states gdp.
endogenous growth theories, unlike exogenous ones, concentrate on the internal qualities of the economic system.
unlike exogenous growth theories, endogenous ones consider technological progress as the important endogenous variable of the economic system.
endogenous growth theories, which are focused on innovations, show how governments can stimulate economics by motivating their citizens to create innovations and implement them.
in that way, they allow seeing the economic system as a whole exogenous theories show the current state of the system, and endogenous ones point to its future perspectives and evolution.
