media literacy is a critical understanding of mass media, while visual literacy is the ability to understand and create visual messages, interpret and make meaningful information from the image presented.
this report covers how this course has changed my perspective about media and visual arts, including how i am thinking differently between media and culture.
visuals are ways of communication to the consumers for example, kfc has a very good image.
the image presents a fantasy of how sweet their fries and chicken are, and for some reason, some customers visit the place for the first time due to the visual art available.
most people have never visited different places, but through art and images, they can be to tell that different places exist in different parts of the world.
