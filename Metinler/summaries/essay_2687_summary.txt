this essay will examine reasons that prove that representatives of minorities and teens should have access to contraception, while parents consent for their use should not be needed.
the rationale for enabling teens and representatives of minorities access contraception without parental consent
it is predictable that teens will use birth control if they are enabled, as they are willing to prevent unwanted pregnancy zuniga et al., 517.
there is rationale to allow both teens and minors to use the contraceptive without their parents consent is very genuine and vividly supported by that substantial clarification.
another substantial reason for allowing minors to take the contraceptive without parental consent is that most of them consider it a method of reducing the cases of abortion.
therefore, minors should be allowed to use contraceptives without the consent of their parents so that the issues of interstate abortion minimization are maintained.
finally, it is not the responsibility of parents to control the use of contraceptives by teens.
it is possible to conclude that neither representatives of minorities, not teens need parents consent to access any forms of contraception or birth control medications.
