in transplantology, compliance with the ethical principle of not harm in cases where a donor is a living person turns out to be almost impossible.
among the most important problems are the difficulty of ascertaining the death of a person and the problem of voluntary will to donate ones organs after death for transplantation.
for example, routine removal, removal in accordance with the principle of presumption of consent, and removal following the principle of presumption of a persons disagreement with the removal of organs after his death.
thus, this principle allows for taking tissues and organs from a corpse if the deceased person or his relatives have not expressed their disagreement.
obtaining the consent of a person or his relatives to use his organs for transplantation is associated with several ethical and psychological problems.
the pluses of the principle of presumption of consent include the fact that this principle forces a doctor to commit, in fact, a violent act since an action with a person or his property without his consent is qualified in ethics as violence.
