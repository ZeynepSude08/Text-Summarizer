history of co2 laser
co2 laser physics
c02 laser uses a mixture of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and helium gasses as its medium.
the beam transmission system consists of a laser power supply, laser oscillator, reflecting mirrors, cutting torch, gas cylinders, water chiller, and air pump.
in the laser tube, the fusion of gasses is actuated by diodes that emit energy in the form of light.
the photons have the same wavelength as the excited atom thus, all photons in the laser beam have the same wavelength.
