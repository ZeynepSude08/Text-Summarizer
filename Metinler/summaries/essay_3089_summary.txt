the law of conservation of linear momentum depicts that when no external force is applied on the colliding bodies under a given system, then the vector summation of particular bodies of the linear momentum neither changes nor is affected by their nontoone interaction vedantu, n.d..
however, the collision still qualifies for demonstrating the law conservation of linear momentum, as the influence of these external forces is minimal.
