carbon steel, chromium, inconel, stainless steel, titanium, tool steel, and tungsten are the most robust materials.
titanium metals final two electrons are located in the 4th valence shell, resulting in the arrangement 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d2 4s2 kaur  singh, 2019.
furthermore, titanium48 is the most abundant isotope of titanium metal, accounting for approximately 74 of natural element abundance kaur  singh, 2019.
titanium44, 45, 51, and 52 are the most stable tungsten element isotopes.
there are physical parameters that play a significant role in titanium metal strength.
titanium metal is a hard material with a 434 mpa tensile load, close to a reduced metal alloy kaur  singh, 2019.
with a combination of titanium and other metallic elements, the composites can yield tensile strengths of approximately 1,400 mpa kaur  singh, 2019.
figure 1 below shows the strength of titanium metal, while table 1 shows some physical properties of titanium.
because titanium is in the center of the table, it has properties that fall somewhere between metals and nonmetals.
moreover, titanium metal can show similar actions at 610 o c temperature when pure oxygen exists.
titaniums thermophysical properties prevent it from melting under normal circumstances because it deteriorates much more responsive at higher temperature ranges and bursts into flames if oxidation particles are present in its surroundings kaur  singh, 2019.
titanium is a transition metal with chemical properties similar to chrome and vanadium, particularly in lower valence states.
by solidsolution hardening, antimony can increase the strength of titanium by up to 10 kaur  singh, 2019.
tungsten is a unique material, almost wholly found in substances with other elements.
additionally, tungsten has the highest thermal conductivity, with 5,930 c extreme temperatures fu et al., 2021.
tungsten substances are frequently employed as catalyst support and are the only material in the third change metal occurring in biomolecules, with a few strains of bacteria and archaea containing it.
tungsten melts at 3,410 c, the greatest tensile resolution at more than 1,650 c extreme temperatures, and the lowest linear expansion coefficient 4.43 106 per c fu et al., 2021.
much tungsten is used in the production of titanium metals, and some of it is used in the aircraft industries to produce jet engine injector gullets and slash reentry surface irregularities.
