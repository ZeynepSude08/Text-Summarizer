there is, therefore, a question of whether kate was finally tamed or not.
i am convinced that petruchio is not successful in taming kate.
in conclusion, the interaction of kate and petruchio is far from portraying a taming relationship.
all the personal attributes that kate receives prove that kate is more liberated than tamed at the end.
