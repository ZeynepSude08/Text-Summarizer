in the novella titled a river runs through it, written by norman maclean, the two essential topics are fly fishing and religion.
therefore, it may be safe to say that there will be several crucial differences between macleans novella and redfords movie.
the primary difference between the novella and its movie adaptation is the depiction of paul and his life.
from a young age, paul was much more of a troublemaking figure than norman, and the movie a river runs through it does not take a toll on the novella by focusing on the boat scene and amplifying the dissimilarities carried by paul and norman.
