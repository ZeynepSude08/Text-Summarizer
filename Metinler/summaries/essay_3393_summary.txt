timbuk2 messenger and laptop bags are manufactured in different factories and workshops.
thus, messenger bags are produced in san francisco, while laptop bags and backpacks are manufactured primarily in china.
timbuk2 does not offer the option to customize those bags to the customers, resulting in more products being manufactured at a faster rate.
as the factory in china is more automated than the one in san franciso and custom bags are not offered, the company can afford to order a large amount of raw material and use it to produce their goods.
