this paper aims to explore the theme of marriage using two couples from notable plays, nora and torvald from a dolls house 1879 and rose and troy from fences 1985.
a dolls house explores love and marriage in great detail by illustrating the relationship between nora and torvald.
at the beginning of the play, the two spouses appear to be in a happy relationship nora speaks lovingly of her husband, while torvald affectionately uses pet names to refer to his wife.
while their marriage has been built on love, it is still ruled by social norms and expectations, with nora having to obey her husband and allow him to make decisions on behalf of their couple.
even though her husband has played the role of a reputable man who values his place in society, nora believes that torvalds love for her is much stronger and more profound.
both rose and nora have played by the rules of society and acted as obedient wives who will push their desires and dreams aside for the sake of their husbands.
