the cohort study is a valuable method for healthcare research because it analyzes several hypotheses and compares the outcomes simultaneously.
the former requires considering the participants characteristics to form groups and study intervention, and, in contrast, the randomized format makes researchers eliminate any individualized factors from the equation naidoo et al., 2020.
another significant distinction is the timing because cohort studies require to be conducted for a prolonged period to retrieve sufficient evidence to make conclusions and observe the interventions results thampy et al., 2019.
the cohort study tends to be related to extensive epidemiological research because interventions require participants with diverse conditions to be involved and observed for an extended period.
the cohort study design is in the middle of the research pyramid, meaning that the quality of conclusions is not the highest, yet sufficient for gathering information for further decisionmaking.
