at the same time, it is possible to work with the dog and train it to perform certain actions necessary for the owner.
in the process of training, the trainer influences the behavior of the dog and changes it in the desired direction.
the behavior of a trained dog is controlled by the trainer, who induces the dog with his signals, including commands and gestures, to perform certain actions.
the longer the time interval between the positively evaluated actions of the dog and the reward, or between the negatively evaluated actions of the dog and punishment, the longer the reflex is developed, and the more errors occur during training.
at first, a trainer can encourage the dog every time, but gradually, as the dog begins to understand the command, reduce the edible rewards to nothing so that it does not think that the point of the action is to get a treat.
