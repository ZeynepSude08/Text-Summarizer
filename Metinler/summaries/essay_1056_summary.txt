the storm appears to be a continuation of kate chopins at t he cadian ball .
both stories have the same main characters bobinot, calixta, alcee, and clarisse.
clarisse being a creole means that she is of a higher social status, and that is why she does not go to the ball and wonders why alcee does.
at assumption, where the cadian ball is taking place, on finding calixta, alcee takes her with him to a more private area where they go on flirting until clarisse comes and goes with alcee.
like most of kate chopins writings in the early 20th century, at the cadian ball is a work of feminism with calixta as an icon of daring women at the time who went against the social order and standards set.
