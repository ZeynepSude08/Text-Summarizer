clinical laboratory science is very essential in the diagnosis of infections and disorders.
some diseases like rheumatoid arthritis are interesting to learn due to their unique laboratory tests performed.
this is the laboratory testing of patients in operating rooms, recovery areas, patients bedside, or home testing.
most of laboratory accidents are usually caused by lack of paying attention to instructions, carelessness, and lack of concise and proper communication during the testing.
therefore, errors in the preanalytical phase, for example, in blood sample collection and patient identification, and analytical errors like verifying the accuracy of abnormal results are avoided as well as postanalytical mistakes like communication of tests results are avoided.
this procedure should be carried out by trained personnel to ensure the patients safety and that the correct results are obtained, and no complications like iatrogenic anemia arise.
this process can be conducted by testing the presence of diseases in the blood or typing the blood before it is transmitted.
coagulation is the process by which coagulation factors, plasma proteins, and calcium are subjected to work together on the platelets surface to make or form a strong fibrin clot.therapeutic anticoagulation therapy uses glycoprotein receptor drugs such as abciximab, eptifibatide, aspirin and clopidogrel, intravenous antiplatelet membrane, and thrombolytics.
