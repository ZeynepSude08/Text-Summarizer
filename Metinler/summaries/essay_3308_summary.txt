everyone has different definitions of terms associated with their identity, such as caring, loving, and hardworking mother or wife.
for me, i am a caring person, and most of the people i relate to know that.
love is an important key to a happy and fulfilling life and according to me, being a loving person is all about showing expressions of affection to people with no form of selfishness.
for instance, they can only define themselves as loving, caring, and hardworking when other people view them as such.
in society, people can describe you as loving and caring based on your actions and their perception of you without considering your motivation for doing so, yet the motive is what matters.
