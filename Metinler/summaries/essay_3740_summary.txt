although the study covers a broad topic and approaches to improve the financial situation and ipo processes, there is an evident scope for future work about valuation, pricing, and institutional investments.
underpricing results vary in companies, and this article investigates the peculiarities of canadian organizations and their ipo pricing policies and longterm performance.
in this article, the author admits that the relationship between ipo valuation, price support, and returns has been poorly investigated, with only one theoretical explanation that underwriters can use high prices only with approved laddering.
there are two main hypotheses in the study to prove that price support ipos decline in shortterm returns and to demonstrate a negative connection between price support and returns.
price stabilization has potential for primary and secondary investors, regulators, and some market players, but researchers could not find enough material about why ipos are constantly overvalued in shortterm returns.
