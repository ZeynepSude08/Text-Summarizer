kinesio taping is actively used both for the prevention of muscle and joint injuries in healthy people and for rehabilitation after various injuries.
kinesio tape easily attaches to the muscular skeleton, supporting or suppressing muscle activity, as well as providing stability to ligaments and joints park et al.
thus, kinesio taping can be used in coaching to prevent the occurrence of joint and muscle injuries, as well as to relieve muscle and joint pain during the rehabilitation period.
the mechanical property of kinesio taping can provide a stable joint position through external physical force park et al.
2. kinesio taping has a positive effect on balance performance and helps prevent injury, especially in healthy athletes.
are partially supported by yang et al., who emphasize that kinesio taping improves control over muscle positioning, which has a positive effect on contraction 4.
4. this assumption is also supported by hosp et al., who emphasize that kinesio tape increases the sensory feedback from mechanoreceptors located in the skin, muscles, and joint capsules 640.
although the studies reviewed suggest the widespread use of kinesio taping for the rehabilitation of various muscle groups, the use in coaching for healthy people depends on the load and nature of the movements.
in particular, as illustrated in an article by park et al., increasing muscle resistance with tape has a positive effect on the results of therapy for dysphagia 1.
at the same time, the effectiveness and results of using kinesio taping to improve the performance of both healthy people and rehabilitation depend on the technique and duration of use.
in general, information on the use of kinesio taping to improve performance in athletes, as well as in rehabilitation after joint and muscle injuries, is controversial.
