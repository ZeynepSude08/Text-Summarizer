in the present experiment, a semimicroscale study of the ir spectra of the recrystallized product and raw materials is carried out to confirm the reaction between anthracene and maleic anhydride.
it is expected that the spectrogram of the product of the reaction under study will not only have peaks similar to those of the feedstock but also new peaks unique to the interaction of anthracene and maleic anhydride.
the ratio of a diene to alkene 10.5 or 0.5 g of anthracene to 0.25 g of maleic anhydride is used for the synthesis both substances are dissolved in 6 ml of xylene.
the second step of the procedure was the purification of the reaction product by recrystallization.
the third step of the experiment was to compare the melting point of the recrystallized product with the starting substances that had been used as raw materials.
ir spectra were taken for both the recrystallized product and for anthracene and anhydride.
the dielsalder reaction of anthracene with maleic anhydride.
