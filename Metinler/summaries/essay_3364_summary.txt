clifford wallace, in the judges on judging views from the bench speaks about the concept of judicial restraint  precisely, its theory and practice as well as its philosophy.
according to wallace, the concept of judicial restraint is that in order to to avoid the usurpation of the decisionmaking role of democratically elective agencies and officials, judges must always be hesitant in declaring statutes or actions of the government anticonstitutional and must be cautious in supplementing or amending statutes when interpreting them.
in accordance with the foundations of judicial restraint, wallace suggests following the principles he has established when construing the constitution.
the author concludes by noting that judicial restraint rarely allows for the repeal of a law passed by activist judges.
