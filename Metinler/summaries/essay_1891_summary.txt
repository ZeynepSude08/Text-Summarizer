in the context of the classroom, translanguaging encourages the students to use both target and home language when expressing ideas, simultaneously creating the environment of sharing linguistic skills in both languages and educating each other without the urge for the minorities to conform to the standardized norms bauer et al., 2020.
hence, a formative assessment of a latinx learners english language will limit their ability to communicate and perform cognitive skills.
hence, translanguaging is a phenomenon that encourages bilingualism as a central tool to learn a language rather than an additional aspect of ones communication abilities.
a significant role in this team is played by a speechlanguage pathologist, as this professional is invited to the classroom to work with the learners who have difficulties in their communication, articulation, and linguistic skills.
when collaborating with a speechlanguage pathologist, teachers can ensure informal communication in the classroom that masters the cognitive perception of a learner.
thus, for example, when a child in the classroom has specific challenges in terms of speech and communication, as a speechlanguage professional, i will address the teacher with the favor to encourage coping mechanisms and learning tools in the classroom for this student.
