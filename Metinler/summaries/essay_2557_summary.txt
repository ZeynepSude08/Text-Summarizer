the capstone projects main objective is to improve the welfare of patients admitted to the hospitals surgical ward by reducing fall rates.
this capstone project helps prioritize the adverse effects associate with falls by proposing an innovative and multidisciplinary solution that can be applied to the surgical department.
in addition, they do not include the application of risk assessment tools and multidisciplinary teams to address patient falls.
while the department applies standardized intentional rounding, it has not been streamlined to address the increasing frequency of patient falls.
for instance, the literature review can be used to inform change and best practices that will benefit the patients by ensuring their risk of falling is reduced.
in addition, the organization will benefit from improved fall prevention initiatives which will significantly reduce the cost of care by reducing hospital stay and avoiding lawsuits.
it is worth noting that a successful nursedriven change practice will encourage future nurses to engage in innovative projects designed to address critical patient issues.
the one aspect of the project that did not go well was the lack of realtime feedback from nurses regarding the fall prevention initiatives in place at the facility.
in addition, research findings were critical in the decision to use risk assessment tools to categorize patients prone to falls.
