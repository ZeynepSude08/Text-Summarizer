the work of a spectrophotometer is based on this law to calculate the amount of light, its absorption, and concentration.
the law states that the way of how a substance absorbs light is proportional to its sample concentration amount thus, there is a linear relationship between the elements khan academy, 2010.
when it is necessary to measure chemical substances or determine reactions, spectrophotometers are offered to analyze the intensity of light absorbed after passing a solution with a certain level of chemical substances concentration.
