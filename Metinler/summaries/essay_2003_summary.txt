as for cardiopulmonary processes, in copd, the breakdown of lung tissue resulting in suboptimal airflow, the alteration of lung function, increased oxidative stress, and increases in cough reflex sensitivity contribute to increased hypoventilation, severe uncontrollable cough, and shortness of breath mccance  huether, 2019 radovanovic et al., 2018.
regarding cardiovascular processes and their interactions with cardiopulmonary ones, emphysema found in copd patients can cause increased pressure in the arteries between the lungs and the heart, resulting in pulmonary hypertension and low blood oxygen levels that increase the workload on the heart morgan et al., 2018.
however, there are suggestions that cardiovascular symptoms are more prevalent in copd patients with high bmis and a small airway form of copd, both of which are more typical for races other than asian morgan et al., 2018.
