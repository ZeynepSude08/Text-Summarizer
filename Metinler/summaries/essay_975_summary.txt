a style section should not replace the womens page because it addresses womens issues in a maledominated society.
the style section in any newspaper presents information that the public can do without, while the womens page can actually help.
women have a voice and can contribute to society, thus emphasizing the womens page rather than the style section.
in 1969, there was a transition from the womens page to the styles section.
