an episode of black mirror, the british science fiction series, shows the impact of information technology on human relations in exaggerated form.
a technological future allows a man to reveal moments inaccessible to a person in our reality.
criticism may be related to the fact that the concept takes away humanity from a person and assumes that new technologies will be available only to societys elite.
it is difficult to find answers to global questions about the overall development of technologies and humanitys future in the new conditions of existence.
