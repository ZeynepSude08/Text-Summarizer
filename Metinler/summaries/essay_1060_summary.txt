at the center of this bleak situation is a speedy climate change whose causes and effects human population growth and overdependence on deteriorating marine ecosystems  are becoming increasingly difficult to mitigate due to governance shortcomings.
climate change and population increase are becoming increasingly difficult to perceive distinctly, especially when the question is about the loss of a diverse marine environment.
climate change is arguably the biggest threat to australias diverse marine environment.
although hallett et al.s 2017 study focus on southwest australia, their warning about the adverse effects of climate change are convincing.
convinced that australias marine migratory species are of national significance, miller et al.
australia risks losing many migratory species, a crucial part of the marine environment, due to chronic policy dysfunction that exposes these organisms to incalculable anthropogenic threats in unprotected areas.
amidst these difficulties and failures, climate change and debris remain the leading causes of residual risks in the marine environment.
the debate about the implications of climate change on australias marine life is not necessarily pessimistic.
perhaps the most convincing acquittal of climate change as the precursor to the threats to the diverse marine environment is the lack of comprehensive knowledge regarding the area.
2021 examined the combined effect of climate change and local human stressors in marine ecosystems.
taken together, it is believable that climate change will expose marine environments along with ecosystems to unprecedented challenges, some of which are difficult to comprehend in full scope due to limited knowledge.
in conclusion, australias diverse marine environment faces numerous risks due to climate change, whose effects are eluding mitigation and avoidance measures due to poor governance.
