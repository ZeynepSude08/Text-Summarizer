several organs and specific cells are fundamental in the process of neuronal activation.
gproteinlinked receptors act as activators of intracellular signal transduction ways, which then lead to a cellular response.
nevertheless, nowadays, scientists can study neural activations on various frequencies hesse, 2020.
scientists study a process of neural activity using highinnovative technologies.
