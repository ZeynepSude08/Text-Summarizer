the schools administration had demanded that the people responsible for the actual policies take measures in order to identify the reasons for such dramatic changes to the budget income.
as the school is facing its direst times due to the cut in funds that have been announced recently, the system has to undergo specific changes in order to ensure the survival of our institution.
one of the possible reasons for the investors to pull back their investments could be the fact that our school staff is no longer capable of providing their students with the proper level of education.
this information will be presented as a new school policy that the administration should apply to all staff activity spheres.
and logically, since the investors are pulling out their funds from the school budget, the staff must undergo drastic changes from the very roots of the organization.
after this stage and the increase in the incoming funds from the investment sources, the school management must ensure that the money dedicated to the specific parts of the institution will serve its purposes.
the entire school staff must see the way the system works so they will be able to follow its policies.
an open network of school expenses will allow the investor to perceive the way their investments are used in order to better the organization and therefore attract even more assets due to its superiority on the market of education.
to conclude, the school can recover the lost funds only by making a change to all of the described aspects of its organization.
therefore, it is now vital to take such steps toward improving the school and making it more competitive in the modern arena of investors funds.
