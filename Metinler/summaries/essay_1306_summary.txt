george orwells politics and the english language is an essay in which the author has criticized certain techniques that make the language redundant, the message unclear, and people confused or manipulated into believing in insincere information.
orwell has highlighted that the ways in which language is being manipulated are through vagueness, complex phrasing with no significant meaning, changing an idea through less offensive wording, and a lack of a specific essence that the writer wants to express.
asking direct questions, having straight conversations on certain literature pieces, and applying a less vague approach to examining texts are the techniques that can be integrated based on orwells principle.
it is vital to mention that manipulating a text by either adding complexity through unnecessary words or formulating the idea based on an agenda may change how a reader understands the content.
this may be implemented by providing examples or certain texts, similar to the ones orwell used in the essay, and having a conversation with the students regarding the manipulations that writers used to create a new or altered connotation.
