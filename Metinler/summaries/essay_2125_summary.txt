this is due to a number of reasons, perhaps the most obvious and common being the desire to simply demonstrate the fact that one can afford to buy expensive brand clothes, a luxurious car and so on.

nowadays, the middle and social classes also tend to purchase fine jewelry pieces that are more expensive than they can generally afford.
