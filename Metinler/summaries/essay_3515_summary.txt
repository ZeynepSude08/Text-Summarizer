3. genomic mutations of pseudomonas aeruginosa
the number of rrnas and trnas is 13 and 63, respectively, with a total of 30 remaining rna forms  pseudomonas aeruginosa , n.d..
the data show that fourteen common virulent genes are characteristic of pseudomonas aeruginosa .
these data clearly show that some of them had the highest frequency of occurrence, while others  e.g., exou n, which was present in only 28 of the 90 strains observed  were the least common in pseudomonas aeruginosa .
these, with respect to pseudomonas aeruginosa , include flagella, exotoxins, phospholipase c and protease a, qs proteins, elastase, and some other examples of natural forms within the bacterium alonso et al., 2020.
