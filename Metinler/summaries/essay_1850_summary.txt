the identified determinants are directly related to the defined disparities, as they allow researchers to describe the risk factors for salmonella infection.
additionally, the inability to provide sanitary conditions on farms as a disparity factor leads to an increased risk of infection, which is a determinant.
from the study of the population affected by the health issue, it is possible to identify connections between social and behavioral patterns and the conditions for the spread of the infection.
in particular, sanitary conditions on farms, as well as individual behavioral patterns, have been found to be major determinants of the spread of infection.
