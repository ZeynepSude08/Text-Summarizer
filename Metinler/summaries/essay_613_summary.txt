the statistic, however, can be tampered with due to the fact that many women do not address medical professionals when having postpartum depression ppd because they are either unaware of the symptoms or they are unwilling to admit them mughal et al., 2021.
african american women, while more likely to be diagnosed with ppd, are not encouraged to undergo the early ppd screening.
hence, it is reasonable to assume that early ppd screening in african american women plays a crucial role in the timely detection and prevention of relapse.
postpartum depression in african american women
ppd screening is not often accessible or provided for african american women and creates complications with mental health at both the twoweek and sixweek timeframe.
moreover, overwhelmed with the future of a child, including socioeconomic security overall wellbeing, african american women are more likely to be affected by stress and perinatal complications when bearing a child maxwell et al., 2019.
thus, early intervention and ppd screening are essential to african american women in order for them to feel more comfortable sharing their concerns.
