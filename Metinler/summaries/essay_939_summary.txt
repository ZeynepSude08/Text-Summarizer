one of the most frequently discussed contributors to this process is an unmanned aerial vehicle uav, or drone, which stands for an aircraft controlled without human involvement on board bykzkan  ger, 2018.
despite the challenges that exist in the way of mass uav application to the scm, its adoption is nowadays an unavoidable process that needs to be optimized and embraced by management worldwide.
while people imagine that the application of drone technology is limited by enhanced delivery options for the supply chain, the scope of uav efficiency is currently tested in other areas.
by allocating finance to the optimization of drone technology, including battery improvement, control software, and a weight capacity of a drone, companies can apply uavs to perform both final mile deliveries to trafficked urban areas and remote rural locations.
having taken into consideration the trends of uav application in the scm, it can be concluded that the process of drone implementation, due to its evident potential, will be halted anytime soon.
despite the existing interest in drone technology, its actual implementation is not as common due to the risks and disadvantages associated with uav delivery.
with the existing drone regulations presented by the federal aviation administration, any uav should always remain in visible proximity to the one responsible for vehicle control rejeb et al., 2021.
considering both positive and negative aspects of auvs introduction to the scm, it is reasonable to assume that the current scm environment no longer has the option of dismissing the existence of drone technology as an integral part of delivery, security, and maintenance across the supply chains.
