when it comes to the considerations of epigenetics in terms of a disease for which an individual is at high risk, it is necessary to consider family history as well as environmental factors that add to the development of the adverse health condition.
considering all factors, the most highly likely disease to develop in the future is type 2 diabetes.
in adulthood, type 2 diabetes is likely to develop as a result of behavioral and environmental factors, such as increased blood pressure, elevated levels of fat in the blood, a sedentary lifestyle, high alcohol intake, obesity and overweight, and others rosen et al., 2018.
epigenetics suggests that even in the case of genetic risk factors, there is a possibility to either increase or reduce the chances of developing a disease with the help of environmental and behavioral improvements.
considering that the risk of diabetes and its complications is associated with environmental and inherited factors, it is not surprising that research in this area is extensive rosen et al., 2018.
for example, the authors refer to the article by beckerman, ko, and susztak 2014, who used kidney tissues from patients diagnosed with diabetes and chronic kidney disease to illustrate epigenetic changes in renal diseaserelated genes.
