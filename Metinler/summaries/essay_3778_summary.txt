in his words, thucydides says, the plague was so overwhelming that men, unable to predict what to come, were indifferent in every rule of both law and religion the history of the peloponnesian warii52.
further, in his description of the effects of the athenian plague, thucydides shows that not only was their religious strife, but they also were in doubt concerning the events attributed to the epidemic.
in the history of the peloponnesian war, the plague struck everybody regardless of their piety to the gods.
sophocles lens, the plague comes from religious pollution, and the god apollo requests that thebans exile from the previously unknown moral noxious decay.
what compares sophocles to thucydides is that the deaths resulting from the plagues were severe in both lands.
what correlates between the two plagues is that the epidemic at thebes comes from the same god, apollo, who initiates the plague at athens and strikes thebes.
