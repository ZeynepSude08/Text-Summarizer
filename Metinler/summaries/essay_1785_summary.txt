human kidney graft survival correlates with structural parameters in baseline biopsies a quantitative observational cohort study with more than 14 years of followup.
purpose statement                                                                            the study evaluates associations between structural and ultrastructural parameters in baseline biopsies from human kidney transplants and longterm graft survival after more than 14 years of followup p.
research questions                                                                           is longterm kidney graft survival related to structural parameters in baseline biopsies?
define hypothesis                                                                            the hypothesis of this study is that structural deviations in implantation kidney biopsies have a prognostic impact on longterm graft function p.
summary of assumptions and limitations                                                       the researchers assumed that the longterm kidney graft survival is related to structural parameters.
the authors of the research managed to conduct a cohort study with more than 14 years of followup, examining various data from more than 50 kidney transplantation recipients and their donors.
