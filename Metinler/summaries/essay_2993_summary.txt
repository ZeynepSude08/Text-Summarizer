the great astor, an outstanding argentine composer of the twentieth century, went down in history as the great transformer of tango, a true exponent of the music of buenos aires and the creator of the nuevo tango style.
this musician made the whole world pay attention to the argentine tango and fall in love with it  all this is astor piazzolla, a revolutionary and classic of argentine music of the twentieth century.
mstislav rostropovich played the great tango, written in his honor by piazzolla, in new orleans in 1990 and 1994, on the stage of the colon theater in buenos aires in honor of the memory of the great musician ritter 24.
libertango is just one of the most striking examples of the popularization of argentine tango in piazzollas work.
according to piazzolla, tango in the second half of the 20th century should receive a new development, and its form should have a concert performance, almost next to classical music.
it was thanks to piazzolla, who introduced the bandoneon into the orchestra, that the music of argentine tango received that piercing, aching sound that attracted so many fans to it.
thanks to astor, tango began to be perceived as serious music, and symphonic orchestras began to play his works.
in conclusion, piazzollas work is a constant internal contradiction, revolutionary changes, a craving for academic performance, sensual tango rhythms and classical symphonic suites, a deep love for traditions, and a desire to change them.
perhaps this is the reason why listening to the rebellious tango of astor piazzolla people want to be sad alone, passionately admire the music and live against everything, as el gran astor did.
