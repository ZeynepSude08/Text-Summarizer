this proposal seeks to support the introduction of smart systems and water resource management practices and integrating them in infrastructure and built environments.
from an educational or philosophical perspective, the idea of integrated water resources management iwrm has become a reality today since many communities and companies are implementing coordinated efforts to conserve all landrelated resources to maximize economic and social outcomes for all citizens.
if all partners implement most of the above measures, more ideas and initiatives will emerge in the future that will support the delivery smart systems and result in improved management of scarce natural resources.
