the sources strength is in using statistical data to reinforce its point, but the authors clear bias in favor of abortion rights may be considered a weakness.
it supports this main point by discussing how the increasing prominence of the human rights perspective weakens institutional barriers against abortion rights.
it would be best used to illustrate the argument in favor of abortion rights based on the regnant womens right to health, which is its major strength.
the sources main strength is its empirical foundation, and it can be used to provide data on childrens screen time with digital devices.
however, the weakness of this source is that it only covers internet addiction specifically, while the childrens use of digital devices is not limited to using the web.
its main point is that childrens use of digital devices is both prominent and largely unregulated.
the sources main strength is the wealth of data on how children use digital technology and how dependency on it may affect their development, and its best use in the paper is to cover this topic.
