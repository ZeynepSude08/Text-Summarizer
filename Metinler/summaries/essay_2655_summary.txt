the role of personnel tasked with evaluating a curriculum is very clear regardless of whether internal or external personnel.
internal evaluators better understand the context and environment, while external evaluators provide valuable experience and knowledge ornstein  hunkins, 2018.
i think external consultants for an evaluation are essential and the underlying issues specific to an organization or a school district are integral to the final assessment.
from my observations on evaluations done by external consultants, their engagement has proven to be valuable in the process.
external consultants are perceived to have more power than internal evaluators their expertise and experience will be respected by those being evaluated.
