the prevention and correction of diagnostic errors therefore becomes the primary goal of medical professionals, where the overall wellness and health of patients depends on their work competence.
furthermore, involvement of medical specialists and good medical professionals in the clinical appraisal process can be effective in reducing chances of error.
the process of quality improvement involves understanding the core causes of diagnostic errors and introducing systematic changes to provide better healthcare.
