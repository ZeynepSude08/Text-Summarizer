the fact that patients are willing to communicate with pces rather than physicians and follow the recommendations of the former can be seen as an influential factor contributing to the breach of the psychological contract.
pces are responsible for maintaining proper communication between the physician and the patient.
at krisna hospital, physicians are completely responsible for patient treatment, and their authority is not expected to be questioned by pces which happens quite often.
patients also understand that doctors have the necessary expertise, but in many cases, people choose to follow the recommendations of pces whose expertise is valued more than that of physicians.
to address the psychological breach and improve communication between patients and doctors, it is necessary to design detailed sets of responsibilities for both positions.
pces should stick to the treatment plan and provide recommendations consistent with these plans, ensuring proper communication between the medical staff and patients.
however, pces have no deep medical knowledge, which can have negative patient outcomes, according to krisna hospital physicians.
physicians and pces should discuss their responsibilities and the need to hold a single line based on the developed treatment plan when communicating with patients.
if pces based on patients fears, concerns, personal beliefs, and so on have doubts regarding some choices physicians make, these professionals need to discuss the treatment plan and develop a single communication line.
