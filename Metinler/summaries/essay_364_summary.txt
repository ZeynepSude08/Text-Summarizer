unfortunately, my group is laden with some behavioral challenges such as time management and resistance to direction, which affect performance negatively.
as a group leader, i would approach the problems from a behavioral angle employing such techniques as classical conditioning, positive reinforcement, behavior shaping, behavior modeling, reinforcement schedules, and punishment where applicable.
the approach will apply to solving the problem of time management affecting my groups current affecting members.
i will recognize and commend members who report to their duties on time to inspire a repeated action that would ultimately become a sustained behavior.
shaping my group members behavior could help check their resistance to my ideas.
by adopting a more approachable and collaborative behavior, my team members will reduce their negative perceptions of me and thus help neutralize resistance.
classical conditional, behavior shaping, behavior modeling, and reinforcement are effective inspiring and sustaining positive behavior.
overall, group leaders have a responsibility of keeping members cohesive and focused on the shared objectives.
