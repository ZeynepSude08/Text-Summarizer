the first step involves evaluating a patient on a clinical ventilator to establish the effect of instilling the saline during suction compared to its absence.
the fourth step involves incorporating evidence provided with patient preferences and clinical expertise to determine the appropriateness of saline instillation.
the next step will be used to test the effect of the saline in reducing pain and anxiety for patients.
this approach involves disconnecting a patient from a ventilator and ensuring lungs are well fit with sizeable tidal volume by using the mechanical instrument.
on the other hand, the closed approach allows aspiration tubes to be distributed through an artificial airway without removing the patient from the ventilator.
moreover, the plan helps in improving the level of patient care by providing necessary information that discourages saline use in the event of suction mckinley et al., 2018.
the information also helps practitioners explain to other nurses the need to avoid the use of saline during suction.
