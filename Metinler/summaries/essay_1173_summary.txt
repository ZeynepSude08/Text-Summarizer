critical thinking and decision making essay
in my first journal entry, i defined critical thinking as the art of reasoning, where solving an issue or getting to the bottom of an issue involves the taking of account of all sides in question.
the main concepts important to critical thinking discussed in chapters 12, 13, and 14 were comparative reasoning, empirical reasoning and ideological reasoning.
2017 describe that important concepts in critical thinking will ensure that the skills and dispositions of interpretation, inference, analysis, and inquisitiveness are incorporated before a decision is made.
so, critical thinking will be based on data available, relevant research and individual experiences based on time.
