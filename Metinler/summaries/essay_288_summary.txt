3. effects of aging
the process is marked with significant changes in various body structures and functions that diminish the effectiveness of aged people.
aging refers to the progressive deterioration in physiologic functions within the human body that occur over time.
the aging process manifests as senescence, deterioration in the functional capacity of organs and tissues.
in addition to biological changes, aging is also associated with psychological, economic, and social changes such as retirement world health organization, 2021.
the number of epidermal cells reduces with age resulting in an overall reduction of skin thickness.
at the dermal layer, the number of cells and blood vessels reduces with age.
the hypodermal layer reduces as adipose tissue diminishes with age bont et al., 2019.
the bulk skeletal muscles decrease with age.
muscle activity also diminishes with age as a result of reduced neuronal activity and conduction amarya et al., 2018.
the ratio of adipose tissue to muscle increases with age as more fat is deposited in the muscle.
the reduced quality and quantity of muscles interferes with the ability of aged people to perform various physical functions.
joints become stiffer, and flexibility reduces with age.
