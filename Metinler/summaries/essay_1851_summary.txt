as a human living on solid ground, my lifes purpose is significantly different from a whale swimming in the ocean because of my capacity for selfawareness, higherlevel reasoning, and participation in society.
life meaning is only desired and sought once basic physical needs are met, which is not the case for whales or, unfortunately, even all humans.
in conclusion, humans are capable of achieving transcendent life meaning that animals such as whales are not privy to.
put simply, the meaning of life is a uniquely human endeavor because it is not intrinsic to any existence but rather obtained through willful effort.
