specifically, my argument will be that mediumship is grounded in spiritualism and can actually have a therapeutic effect and promote wellness, as evidenced by many traditional practices, including dangki healing.
i will also provide evidence on how mediums themselves can benefit from mediumship sessions during dangki healing lee and kirmayer, spirit mediumship 2.
i will also state that mediumship enables people to experience positive emotions and has a therapeutic effect.
