one of the most challenging managerial decisions i have been involved in was the need to reallocate employees within the company due to the beginning of the pandemic.
the decision of the manager at the time was to select people working for the company to transfer to another office due to changes in demand for services because of covid19.
in this case, the decisions appeared to be biased since no one controlled the managers actions, and personal preferences were involved.
in conclusion, the analysis of the decision made by the manager following the sixstep model showed that the lack of transparency and limited participation was critical for the outcome.
