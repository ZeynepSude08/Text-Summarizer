students were required to identify different categories of standard plastics and create a journal entry that summarizes each type of plastic, its composition, and its uses.
after summarizing the different types of plastics and their composition, students held discussions to describe the various uses of plastic, particularly in packaging.
in brief discussions in groups of ten, students realized that people use plastics unnecessarily, leading to a lot of plastic waste.
