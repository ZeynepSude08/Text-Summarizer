the american womans growing ability to define her own role and place became a peculiar trait of postmodernist literature works.
the american womans roles detailed above evolved from earlier depictions of women focused on romantic relationships and struggles rather than an infinite diversity of characters.
with that in mind, compared to the eras of realism and naturalism, modernist and postmodernist depictions of american women emphasize independence and the freedom of selfexpression that enable women to fulfill various professional and social roles.
