as a neurogenetic disorder causing intellectual disability, down syndrome involves behavioral inflexibility and restrictiverepetitive behaviors, and the possibility of mitigating these and other symptoms through prenatal chromosome silencing techniques provides a promising yet ethically controversial avenue of research.
specifically, inflexible behaviors in down syndrome and typical development can instrumentalize predictability as an anxiety coping mechanism harrop et al., 2021.
in children with down syndrome, lowerorder behaviors, such as primary motor stereotypies, are more widespread compared to higherorder ones, such as a preference for rituals and the presence of circumscribed interests harrop et al., 2021.
regarding learning, in their study that compares inflexibility scores for trisomy 21 and fragile x syndrome children, harrop et al.
being among the most common neurogenetic disorders, down syndrome affects 1 in more than 800 children and is caused by one extra copy of human chromosome 21 riggan et al., 2020.
therefore, inutero chromosomal silencing could potentially erase behavioral and cognitive differences between typically developing children and those with down syndrome.
in summary, down syndromes behavioral symptoms are not conducive to successful learning and communication, thus causing the need for new treatments, including prenatal chromosomal silencing.
