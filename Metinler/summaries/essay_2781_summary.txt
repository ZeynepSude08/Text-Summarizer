impaired fecundity refers to a condition that relates to infertility but is specific to women who have challenges becoming pregnant or carrying pregnancies to term.
because infertility is an issue that may also be a result of conditions in the male partners body, cases of impaired fertility are not only a problem faced by the female partner.
in the case that a couple decides to treat infertility or impaired fertility, health care providers recommend the simultaneous use of medication and intrauterine insemination.
