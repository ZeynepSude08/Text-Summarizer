this paper discusses the application of lewins change theory in the prevention of pressure ulcers.
according to lewins change theory, the primary phase in preventing pressure ulcers is recognizing the existence of the problem and the class of patients facing the problem.
the next phase of change is the identification of appropriate interventions to prevent the development of pressure ulcers in patients.
this can be done by regularly monitoring how the care practitioners implement the interventions, monitoring pressure ulcer cases, and regularly training nurses on preventing pressure ulcers.
