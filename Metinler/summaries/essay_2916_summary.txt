in my mind, i believe that bull is a profanity that can be referred to as interjections that make no sense, particularly as reprimand while responding to actions or communication perceived as false, unfair, disingenuous, misleading, and deceptive.
to do so, individuals must be aware of the different periods they are participating in bull communication or activities.
