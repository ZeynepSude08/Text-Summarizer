understanding recurring themes that have emerged in the history of nursing is essential in the practice of these healthcare professionals.
observing the work of an expert nurse helped me realize the importance of professionalism, as i observed how to behave in a critical situation.
in my opinion, the key factor that affects the professional image of a nurse is the formation of the right work values.
