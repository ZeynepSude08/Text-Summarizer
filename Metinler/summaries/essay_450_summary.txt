40 of homes have at least five devices with internet access, and the same 40 have at least one device with several vulnerabilities allifah  zualkernan, 2022.
this method is widely used in various cyber security systems, information security, decision validation, web applications, cloud storage, networks, and mobile applications allifah  zualkernan, 2022.
cloud security is related to the threats of information transactions between the device and the cloud.
as a result, appropriate subcriteria were selected for each criterion, and a computational experiment was presented for a pairwise comparison of device security performance allifah  zualkernan, 2022.
the models flexibility is explained by a preliminary study conducted on the sources of vulnerabilities in most devices in the smart home allifah  zualkernan, 2022.
