hydrological conditions heavy precipitation can be forecast with some confidence, and warnings can be issued for areas susceptible to mass movement processes caused by such conditions earthquakes tectonics, hazard and risk mitigation, 2017, p.205.
mass movement hazards slope stability, role of gravity, and role of water
a mass movement event can occur at any time when the slope becomes unstable.
the mass movement can then restore the angle of repose of the slope.
mass movement hazard predictions understanding of slope stability and triggering events
all slopes are subject to the dangers of mass movement in a triggering event.
thus, all slopes must be assessed for the potential threat of mass movement.
