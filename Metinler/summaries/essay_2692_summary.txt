the purpose of the analysis will be to determine if the proportion of returned blenders with new switches were deferent from the proportion of blenders with old switches.
in order to test for proportions, two independent samples of blenders need to be taken and the proportion of returned blenders need to be compared.
the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the proportions of returned blenders with new and old switches.
the alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant difference between the proportions of returned blenders with new and old switches.
the test results revealed that there was no significant difference between the proportions of returned blenders with new and old switches with a significance level of 0.05.
