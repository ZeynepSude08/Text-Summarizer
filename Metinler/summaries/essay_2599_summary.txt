from this perspective, robotization is an ethically laudable development because, instead of mechanical jobs taken by robots, it will promote more meaningful and fulfilling jobs for humans.
the main argument why the effect of robotization on employment deserves a positive ethical evaluation is that it will make jobs more meaningful and rewarding.
the obvious objection to this argument is that, although providing some people with more meaningful and rewarding work, robotization will also deprive others of their jobs.
thus, if developments that promote unhappiness are ethically bad, and the unhappiness from job positions destroyed overweighs the happiness from job positions becoming more rewarding, robotization is unethical.
as mentioned above, the job positions that are most likely to be filled by robots are those that provide relatively little opportunity for professional development, social relationships, recognition, and autonomy frey and osborne 268.
moreover, the new nonrobotized jobs that automation creates will probably be more creative, socialoriented, and, hence, more meaningful and rewarding than the old ones taken over by robots.
