after three centuries of slavery, almost one hundred years of jim crow, and decades of racial segregation, yet america has still a long way to go regarding the economic equality of its white and black citizens.
economic inequality among whites and blacks has become an especially heated topic of current discussions about race, discrimination, and generational wealth.
the following essay focuses on the reasons why it is challenging for the black community in the united states to accumulate wealth and move upwards on the economic ladder.
this statement reveals that the black community has not been the only one affected by the challenges associated with economic mobility.
the end of slavery seems to be only the beginning of the black communitys struggle to overcome the legal barriers on the way to economic mobility.
thus, it becomes apparent that the challenges the black population faces on the way to economic mobility are systemic structural discrimination and racist prejudices, rather than individual factors.
unless the government learns from past mistakes and initiates solutions to alleviate barriers to racial economic equality in the u.s., there is little to no hope that the black community will prosper and succeed in the long run.
in conclusion, it is crucial to recognize that there are numerous challenges, which limit the ability of black people throughout the united states to accumulate and transfer wealth generationtogeneration.
segregation, discrimination, and the overall government support of the narrative of inequality between whites and blacks have all contributed to the politics of racial economic disparity.
