the article the image of god by genesis file seeks to disprove darwins theory of evolution and prove that life on earth was created by external intelligence 2021.
the authors main arguments against evolution are the growth of molecular chaos and the scarcity of transitional forms in the annals of fossils, which supposedly contradict darwins theory of evolution.
the fact is that this argument is cited as proof that an organism cannot change its form and evolve into other species on its own.
however, the articles author argues that since none of them evolved further over the last few hundred thousand years of modern homo sapiens existence, the whole theory of evolution is flawed genesis file, 2021.
another argument to refute the article argues that our species has been around for a relatively short time relative to those that have undergone more striking evolution.
the second flaw in the articles argument is that primitive organisms could never have evolved into humans.
another flaw in the articles argument is the citation of the lack of transitional forms in the annals of the fossil record as a fact in favor of the absence of evolution.
consequently, the author erroneously argued that the species homo sapiens is incapable of evolution and that a singlecelled organism cannot transform into a multicellular organism on its own.
