this paper will explore, summarize, and criticize the main points of the case study about aircraft maintenance by ward et al..
in the article titled a performance improvement case study in aircraft maintenance and its implications for hazard identification, its authors point out several times that aircraft maintenance is a highly regulated, safetycritical, complex industry currently facing unprecedented challenges ward et al., 2010, p.
the abstract and introduction sections include allimportant background information about aircraft maintenance and related aviation technology topics ward et al., 2010.
the authors note that many hangar workers and the entire base maintenance department served as data sources for the study ward et al., 2010.
the writers argue that the proposed operating system model positively influenced the performance and safety in the hangar and boosted the process efficiency of aircraft maintenance in the company where the study took place ward et al., 2010.
researchers conclude that a large number of diverse sources within the systematized reporting model in aerospace companies can not only significantly reduce various risks but also create an extensive and flexible database of working processes ward et al., 2010.
encouraged other researchers to conduct a quantitative study on the discussed topic in the implications section ward et al., 2010.
