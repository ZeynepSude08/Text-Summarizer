robin givhans article shifting beauty, published in 2020, examines the changing perceptions of beauty in the fashion industry.
according to givhan, alek wek represented a shift from the traditionally held standards of beauty in the united states since she was dark, while most of those who appeared before her were lighter in complexion.
although the author adequately demonstrates the increasing diversity in the fashion industry, the criticism on shifting beauty standards is blemished since the justification for the criticism is inadequate, the beauty standards established before were innately discriminatory, and the premise upon which the criticism is founded is fallacious.
the author tries to justify her criticism of the shift in beauty standards through two main arguments.
first, the author argues that changes in beauty standards have been unwarranted.
according to givhan, alek wek represented the departure from the conventional beauty standards.
elle represented a time in which magazines influenced the view on fashion and beauty rather than the people influencing beauty standards.
that, in itself, is beautiful.
the author argues that the standards of beauty have changed, and the fundamental component of this argument is the models used in magazine covers.
clearly, as the author states, alek wek was not the reflection of the idea of beauty within society.
when these people congregate on contemporary forms of interaction such as social media, it is evident that the shift in beauty standards is a genuine shift in mindset despite the fact that givhan does not agree with such a notion.
