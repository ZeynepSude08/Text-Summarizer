objectoriented programming, eventdriven programming. machine codes basic programming paradigms involve representation instructions term numbers. general programmer, utilizing machine codes cumbersome almost impossible developing large software. procedural programming involves following predetermined path describes task program accomplish procedures complete task. paradigm operates instructing computer well go accomplishing specific task nrmark, 2011. need large complex software led development objectoriented programming well eventdriven programming. objectoriented programming paradigm utilizes data structures referred objects interact accomplish given task. edp hand paradigm program flow partially dependent user interaction. features examples oop edp programming languages used oop share several features. first feature utilize objects classes code development. object unit information contains procedures referred methods, well data fields referred attributes schach, 2006. classes
