The key elements of music are melody, rhythm, dynamics, timbre, and harmony. Each of them has an important function and, in many respects, determines a composition character. The melody conveys a general mood and, as Kamien (2007) notes, is the main means of expression. The rhythm defines the ratio of the duration of sounds to one another in a single composition. Dynamic shades serve as a tool for the sound coloring of a particular piece. The timbre is a color characteristic of each musical instrument. Finally, the harmony enhances expressiveness, making any melody brighter and richer.


In addition to these elements, music also has a structure, a key, a texture, and a form. The first component is important from the standpoint of the formation of a particular component into a single work. The key is the driving force, shaping a certain melodyâ€™s overall character. The texture allows an understanding of how all the elements are connected within a single melodic unit. Finally, the form is the final version of a composition, which forms its perception.

According to the method of extracting the sound, it is customary to distinguish brass, percussion, strings, and keyboards. The first type is often used in academic orchestras and jazz bands. Percussion samples allow tapping out the rhythm and are a constant attribute of almost any ensemble. String instruments make it possible to extract melodies through vibrating, and their use is typical for different groups, including both modern bands and classical orchestras. Finally, keyboard samples are called due to the method of extracting sound through keys, and they are popular in all ensemble types.
