Introduction
Socialization is an integral part of human life, and it determines one’s success in many spheres. However, even though this process is significantly affected by hereditary factors, the environment seems more important for determining one’s interaction patterns with peers (“Chapter 4”). For example, the pandemic’s beginning proved that external circumstances lead to the emergence of restrictions, which modify how people communicate (Dagalev et al.). Therefore, personality development within a community is limited by the government’s policies, and personal conditions do not play a significant role.

Main body
Any shifts in public life, such as the spread of coronavirus infection and measures intended to combat it, change citizens’ values related to the social aspect. Thus, according to Dagalev et al., similar events result in the formation of new norms of socializing, which influence the dynamics in this area. Young people are reported to find ways of communicating with friends, which are mostly connected to playing online games together (Dagalev et al.). In this situation, it is evident that the skills developed in the process will drastically differ from those of the previous generations, who benefited from physical meetings with others. This challenge allows considering the change as a negative phenomenon because the creation of the self is unlikely to be successfully performed.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the described problem of the dependency of socialization on the external environment presents a threat to youngsters’ future. Their interactions online for all occasions cannot substitute real-life communication and, consequently, do not contribute to the formation of a healthy personality. Thus, such occasions seem alarming from the perspective of people’s psychological well-being and should be addressed in the first place since they are more important than hereditary factors.
