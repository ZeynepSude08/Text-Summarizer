Introduction
The four physiographic regions of the European continent are the divisions into which the physical landscape of the European continent is put. These divisions are as follows: the central uplands, the alpine system, the north European lowland, and the western uplands.

Most of the coalfields found on the continent are located in the central uplands of the European landmass. These coalfields are quite beneficial to the development of different cultures in Europe since they are a source of income to different people who have different cultural beliefs and practices. This aspect of the coalfields being avenues for employment opportunity best explains the growth of cultural diversity on the continent. As a countermeasure against the increasing number of culturally diverse people, the region is much endowed with coal, as evidenced by many coal mines in the region. This is a booster in the development of the economy. Further, it should be noted that it was in the central uplands region that the industrial revolution picked its roots. A region like north European has fertile land that is good for agriculture. Additionally, many navigable rivers are found here.

Besides, the technological skills of the people on the continent are quite unmatched. Thus, the question of space is countered by their technical skills, and therefore most of the construction in Europe is vertical and not horizontal. This is the best way to house so many people on a very small landmass.

Conclusion
It can be easily concluded that though the physiographic regions of Europe are small, the problem is unsettled by the continentâ€™s technocrats, an endowment in minerals, good land that is suitable for agriculture, and the presence of many navigable rivers are the major reasons why these regions are few but can support a variety of culture in the European continent.
