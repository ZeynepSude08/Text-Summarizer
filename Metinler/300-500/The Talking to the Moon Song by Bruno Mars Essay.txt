I chose the song by Bruno Mars called “Talking to the Moon.” The song is not explicitly about the Moon, but Mars uses it as a metaphor for a girl who is far from him. The Moon is portrayed as a distinct object that shares its light with people and the Earth. It can be said that it is scientifically right as the Moon is far from the Earth and shows its bright side in the dark. I like this song due to its melody and lyrics in which Bruno Mars makes a parallel between the girl he loves and the Moon. Both seem close to him, but in reality, they are not reachable to him.

The Moon has an important link with the Earth: if there was no moon, our everyday life as humans would be drastically altered. The first and most noticeable difference would be at night. Nights would be extremely dark, as the Moon gives light to the Earth during the night by reflecting sunlight. The Moon’s gravity causes our planet’s seas to rise and fall. There is minimal friction between the flowing water and the rotating Earth as it flows. Due to this friction, the Earth’s rotation slows somewhat. If there was no moon, the water would spread evenly across the earth, reducing friction.

The Moon also plays a crucial role in the cultures of different civilizations. Without the Moon, there are no Goddesses, beliefs, and practices. It seems that people would live in the dark and find new saint objects if there is no moon. With regards to astronomy, without the Moon, I think there would be no high interest in researching the sky and finding new planets and stars. I believe that the Moon was one of the key phenomena that made people look up and search for answers from the sky.
