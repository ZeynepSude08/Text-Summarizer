Gordon Ramsay is familiar to the general public, not interested in the world of haute cuisine, as an eccentric chef hosting various culinary TV shows. He is also one of the highest-paid and most popular cooks today, due in part to his media activities. Nevertheless, Gordon Ramsay is my favorite chef, as, on closer inspection, he appears to be a high-class professional and a brilliant mentor. The chief plays an important role both in modern culinary art and in the cultural development of a wider audience.

First of all, Gordon Ramsay is a master of culinary art in the field of European cuisine. Not only has he earned more than ten Michelin stars as one of the top ten chefs in the world, but he also successfully owns several prestigious restaurants. He especially focuses on training his staff and improving their skills. For Gordon Ramsay, the quality of cuisine comes first, and he strives not only to make money using his knowledge but also to contribute to the development of the worldâ€™s culinary culture. By observing his mentoring behavior, one can notice that he is an excellent teacher. He is quite strict with the quality of cooking of his mentees and is known for choosing rather harsh words. However, he always scrupulously explains all the details and gives advice in difficult moments. These qualities represent the perfect balance that characterizes a successful and high-class chef. In his restaurants, Gordon Ramsay provides guests with exceptional quality dishes due to his skills as a cook and leader.

Most importantly, the chief was one of the first to help popularize haute cuisine among the public. In this regard, it should also be noted that he often focuses on simpler dishes prepared with special attention, so that less experienced people can repeat the recipes at home. Gordon Ramsay often shares his knowledge on social media and television, which makes his work significant not only in the culinary arts but also in the socio-cultural development of society.
