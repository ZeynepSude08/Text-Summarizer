In this work, it is required to characterize the artistic elements in the musical work “Dido’s Lament”. The appearance of the lament performer in itself causes preparation for emotional shock through acting. The singer depicts the process of agony from taking poison, as her character, Dido, is shaking on the floor and experiencing breathing problems. Rising melodies with occasional jumps to the upper octave produce an exciting melancholic experience in the listener’s perception. The repeated chorus, “Remember me, remember me” gradually rising to the highest register for the singer, makes the most exciting impression, being the emotional peak of the whole lament. At the same time, the vocal dynamics is combined with an increase in notes, either provoking the emotional intensity or reaching amazing fragility through the muffled intonations combined with the highest-pitched notes. The composition of the lament, which represents the process of dying and then mourning the dead Dido by a whole choir, also makes a strong emotional impression. The mournful emotion is achieved by complete synchronization between the melodic movements of the choir and the string accompaniment.

Instruments are included in the gradual and insinuating arrangement of this work. At first, the sound has a certain severity and determination given by the solo piano. Subsequently, the cello that takes over gives a bitter and tragic tone, and the violins joining the part already create a complete emotional immersion in the sad world of the heroine of the opera. Violin timbres, taking into account the slow, lethargic pace of the parts played, evoke a lingering impression of emotional suffering. My personal emotions, in my opinion, are in sync with those that Purcell sought to evoke with this work. “Dido’s Lament” evokes a feeling of sadness and creates an atmosphere of all-consuming mourning, and I have definitely experienced this heavy emotional load.
