In my understanding, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are the needed help in resolving shortage of food throughout the world. Scientists create a more robust and better version of the current vegetables, fruits and other items humans consume. For example, as far as I know, the current version of bananas is GMO since, in the wilds, bananas had large seeds, were green and looked utterly dissimilar to the yellow delicious fruit people are familiar with. GMO enhances the taste of a product and the amount of the product, which is why it can be a possible solution to resolving the worldwide hunger issues.

For the reason that I was interested in GMOs and did my research before, the article did not change my perception of it much since I have already known what GMOs are and that they are a predominant source of food presently. Moreover, as the population number will increase in the future years, the GMO industry will have to expand and adopt new methods of cultivating food (Uji, 2016, p. 78). Therefore, humanity will progress and benefit from the usage of such technologies.

The way a GMO was created does not matter to me as much because I trust scientists. They would not release a vegetable or an animal that would be hurtful for people since they do their research and check their specimens for safety. Therefore, a released and cultivated GMO, whether created through intragenesis or transgenesis, are safe for humans.

I feel proud that humanity has gone so far in improving natureâ€™s gifts and improving the quality and quantity of cultivated foods. GMO technologies are on the right track since they aid people in ending the problem of hunger worldwide. Moreover, GMOs are more affordable and accessible since they can survive more than their natural counterparts.
