A frame of reference is a set of assumptions that underlies the thoughts people form about the world around them. Whenever an event occurs, they try to rationalize and explain it using these ideas to obtain an understanding of what has taken place. When two people share the same frame of reference, they can communicate effectively, as each can interpret the otherâ€™s meaning correctly. On the other hand, with different reference frames, possibilities for misunderstandings arise that may not necessarily be apparent to either party.

Typically, a person will be using a reference frame that arises from their life experiences. Their culture and upbringing will define the knowledge they have and the behaviors they view as acceptable or otherwise. As such, a person with a more diverse set of experiences will typically have a broader reference frame than one that has lived their life within a single location or culture. This broadness is beneficial from a conversational viewpoint, as it lets one understand different people better. As such, people are often encouraged to actively enhance their knowledge and seek new experiences to improve their understanding of the world.

Fiction is one example of a context where one has to adopt a different frame of reference. This consideration particularly applies to unrealistic settings such as fantasy or science fiction. In them, society and culture have been changed dramatically by the different circumstances in which society developed, and actions have to be reinterpreted in that context. Another field where a different frame of reference is necessary is history, as the culture and beliefs of humanity as a whole evolve constantly. It is unproductive to judge past figures by modern standards, particularly with regard to ethics, if such concepts had not existed yet at the time or were viewed as unviable.
