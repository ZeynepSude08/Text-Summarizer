According to Confucius, a Junzi, or true gentleman, was a man of virtue. Confucius’s teachings explained the characteristics of a gentleman as a superior man, a man at his best, and a portrayer of authentic manhood. Meaning is added to the relationship between human beings, referred to as Jen by Confucius, by incorporating the idealness of the terms of human relationships (Chun-Tzu). Confucian gentleman comprises five major characteristics: humility, sincerity, graciousness, magnanimity, and diligence.

According to him, an individual who can practice all five of them can be considered as a superior man/ a portrayer of true manhood or put a gentleman. From the teachings of Confucius, there is no indication that a gentleman looks upon his endeavors and looks down upon those below him; but rather a gentleman’s endeavors pull others towards him (Damrosch et al. 600).

Confucius says that humility and sincerity make others put their trust in a person. He states further that humbleness comes with respect; being magnanimous attracts many to one’s side and getting along with one’s subordinates you need to be gracious.

Confucius’ understanding of his relationship to others whether above or below him is pegged on the characteristics that refer to a person as a gentleman, a man of virtue. According to him, a man of this nature that encompasses all these characteristics is a force that can bring change to society and turn it into a peaceful environment, the state it was and is meant to be.

Another understanding of his relationship with others is found in his belief that each person within the society should act his/her proper part so that society would be better organized. He believes and states that the ruler of an empire should be a ruler while the subject a subject; the father should be a father while the son a son. This shows that he believes in everyone having a specific role to play and should not take up another’s role (Damrosch et al. 602).
